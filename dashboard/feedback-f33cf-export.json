      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-gop-plan-dead-trump-eyes-other-ways-to-reshape-health-care-1490434201With the collapse of Republicans’ health plan in the House on Friday, the Trump administration is set to ramp up its efforts to weaken the Affordable Care Act in one of the few ways it has left—by altering the law through waivers and rule changes.The initiative now rests with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who has vowed to review every page of regulation and guidance related to the ACA. The steps he and the administration take next could have sweeping repercussions, accomplishing some of the same types of changes Republicans were unable to push through Congress.The president was still suggesting Saturday that a broad ACA replacement was eventually possible, but only after the current health system collapsed.“ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE,” the president posted on Twitter, before heading to his golf course in northern Virginia. “Do not worry!”But the administration faces a dilemma. If Republicans, after failing to enact an ACA replacement, weaken the current law in ways that cause people to lose insurance, they could face a political backlash, although Republicans say voters would blame Democrats for any ACA failings.“The Trump administration has a spectrum of options, ranging from actively undermining the ACA marketplaces to administrative actions that start to reshape the insurance market in a more conservative mold,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.The Trump administration could weaken a requirement that most Americans pay a penalty for not having insurance. It could usher in work requirements for Medicaid recipients and ease a directive that insurers cover such services as contraception. And it could also allow an end to certain subsidies that insurers get, which could quickly cause the individual markets to crater.Some of these steps, such as new likely requirements for Medicaid enrollees, are already under way. Republican leaders have long said administrative changes are a key part of their plan to change the health-care system. Now it may be largely the only one left.Dr. Price and Seema Verma, the administrator of HHS’ Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, recently wrote a letter to states assuring them of support if they request waivers to impose work requirements on recipients of Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor and disabled.That could make it more likely that states would get federal approval for other changes to Medicaid within their borders, including the possible establishment of premiums, cost-sharing and lifetime caps on benefits.“We intend for this to be the beginning of the discussion on how we can revamp the federal and state Medicaid partnership to effectively and efficiently improve health outcomes,” Ms. Verma and Dr. Price wrote in their letter to governors.The result of such changes could be a wide variation in the health insurance available to low-income residents in different states, depending on whether their governors decide to seek changes to Medicaid. Republican governors are far more likely to push for such alterations.Dr. Price, a former orthopedic surgeon, is limited to some extent in what he can do. Any rewriting of ACA rules would require time and public comment, and opponents are likely to challenge many of the changes in court.“Violating the statute to take coverage from people in need by legislating through executive action is obviously not a good idea, and would be contested in every court to protect the rights of the American people,\" said Andy Slavitt, who served as acting director of CMS under former President Barack Obama.But Dr. Price has great latitude within certain limits. He has already vowed to water down an ACA requirement that most insurers provide a specific raft of benefits, such as maternity and mental-health care. That could lead to less generous benefit packages, a change that conservative Republicans have sought because they say it would lower premiums.Dr. Price could also encourage states to apply for waivers to the law, so they could, for example, try new ways of helping people with higher medical costs.Dr. Price has told states he would welcome waiver requests that include so-called high-risk pools, which offer subsidized insurance to people with expensive medical conditions. Critics say they leave people in the pool with higher premiums and, in some cases, waiting lists for care.The withdrawal of the House GOP health plan means the requirement that most Americans must obtain health insurance or pay a penalty is likely to endure for some time. But Dr. Price could erode that mandate by granting far more generous hardship exemptions to people that let them avoid paying the fine.Even while seeking to change the ACA, Republicans will face pressure to ensure that it doesn’t collapse. GOP leaders say Democrats will be responsible for any problems caused by the law, but Democrats say the responsibility rests with Republicans since they are in power.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said Friday he hadn’t decided whether to push for laws to stabilize the ACA. “The worst is yet to come with Obamacare,” he told reporters after the bill was pulled. “Do we try to prop it up? It is so fundamentally flawed, I don’t know if that is possible.”Mr. Trump also said Friday that “bad things are going to happen to Obamacare” and that Democrats “100% own it.”But in what is arguably a recognition that voters may not view it that way, the administration has already taken steps to shore up the ACA markets. For example, HHS has set stricter limits for people to sign up outside of the health law’s open-enrollment periods, hoping to give insurers more stability and predictability.The administration’s aim had been to maintain the stability of the markets in 2018 so that they didn’t collapse before Republicans enacted their repeal-and-replace legislation. Now that there is no such legislation on the horizon, the GOP’s path forward is less clear.Another wild card is a lawsuit brought by the House of Representatives that has insurers deeply concerned. Depending on what the administration does, the litigation—now on hold—could potentially end federal subsidies that help reduce consumers’ cost-sharing burden. The billions of federal dollars to subsidize the coverage now go directly to insurers.Whatever steps the administration takes next are almost certain to set off another series of intensive political and legal skirmishes, as advocates and lobbyists on all sides seek to push HHS in various directions—and then potentially to court if they aren’t satisfied.—Mike Bender contributed to this article.

      "text" : "Freddie Quell works at a cabbage farm alongside migrant workers in PT Anderson’s “The Master.” (The Weinstein Company) When I talked to him about the economic effects of immigration last month, Center for Global Development migration expert Michael Clemens mentioned that he was working on research on agricultural migrant workers. That research is finally out, in the form of a report released by CGD and the Partnership for a New American Economy, a pro-immigration reform group started by Michael Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch. Clemens's study focuses on the agricultural industry in North Carolina, and more specifically on the North Carolina Growers Association (NCGA), which supplies manual laborers to North Carolina farms. The NCGA is the nation's largest user of the H-2A guest worker program, which is designed with agricultural workers in mind. Under that program's regulations, Clemens explains, NCGA \"must submit an application to the US Department of Labor proving that it has actively recruited US natives and native workers will not take NCGA jobs.\" That data is interesting, because it describes the labor market before any immigrant workers are recruited. That, as Clemens says, \"allows us to assess the willingness of native workers to take farm jobs before they can even be offered to foreign workers, meaning that this study does not miss any impact caused by people who self-select out of an area or occupation because of competition with foreign workers.\" That willingness, he finds, is basically nonexistent. Every year from 1998 to 2012, at least 130,000 North Carolinians were unemployed. Of those, the number who asked to be referred to NCGA was never above 268 (and that number was only reached in 2011, when 489,095 North Carolinians were unemployed). The share of unemployed asking for referrals never breached 0.09 percent. When native unemployed people are referred to NCGA, they're almost without exception hired; between 1998 and 2011, 97 percent of referred applicants were hired. But they don't tend to last. In 2011, 245 people were hired out of 268 referred, but only 163 (66.5 percent) of the hired applicants actually showed up to the first day of work. Worse, only seven lasted to the end of the growing season: For perspective, the NCGA was looking for about 6,500 workers in 2011. Even if every single referred applicant had been hired and finished the growing season, that would have filled only 4.1 percent of the slots available. As a consequence, the vast majority of the workers who start work at NCGA farms are Mexican H-2A visa holders: And Mexican workers are far likelier to stick through the season than native-born workers. About 90 percent were still working five months along, compared to less than 10 percent of native-born workers: The obvious counterargument to this analysis is that there are, by definition, no jobs Americans won't do no matter what. If agricultural labor paid $100 an hour, people would be lining up to take these jobs. So the alternative to foreign work, by this line of reasoning, isn't that these jobs are just disappearing, but them being offered at a higher wage. business wonkblog true Wonkbook newsletter Your daily policy cheat sheet from Wonkblog. Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters It's not so clear that's the case here. For one thing, Clemens looks at a labor market where employers are only using legal labor, which under the H-2A regulations means they have to pay the same wage to native and non-native laborers (a wage set by the government, according to the type of work and the geographic area where it's being done), and thus can't benefit from paying lower wages to migrant workers. If even under that standard, Americans aren't applying for the jobs, even when they have automatic preference over foreign workers, that tells you Americans are really avoiding them. But surely it's possible that, if H-2A didn't exist, the prevailing wage for agricultural work would rise above where it's estimated now, and thus attract more native workers, right? Sure, but it's unclear even that would make a difference. For one thing, the share of workers completing the growing season didn't increase during the recession, during which wages for NCGA jobs grew relative to other wages in the economy. \"The increase in unemployment mirrors a loss of wages generally in the economy — decreased availability of jobs everywhere else in the economy should be reflected in an increased interest in the NCGA farm jobs because people’s ability to earn income across the broader economy is more limited, making these jobs more valuable in comparison,\" Clemens explains. That suggests that similar in scale wage increases wouldn't spur increased demand for these jobs on the part of native workers either. Further, if wages increased too much, these businesses wouldn't be profitable and all the jobs would disappear. Clemens notes that this appears to be the case for cucumber farming. \"If wages were doubled, raising the hourly wage for collecting cucumbers from $9.70 to $19.40, it would be impossible for farmers to grow cucumbers profitably – the farmers’ labor cost per acre per year would be too high,\" he writes. Neither Clemens nor the organizations putting the report out are exactly neutral parties in this debate, of course, but the data they present is fairly compelling. It seems clear that it would take a quite large increase in agricultural wages to get native workers to do these jobs, an increase that could very well put the farms in question out of business. Given that, making it easier to bring in agricultural workers appears to both dramatically benefit those workers and make life slightly more convenient for the industry in question.",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/indexes-beat-stock-pickers-even-over-15-years-1492039859Most actively managed U.S. stock funds were beaten by their market benchmarks over the past decade and a half, a record of underperformance that helps explain why stock pickers are losing billions of dollars in assets each month to low-cost passive investments that track indexes. Over the 15 years ended in December 2016, 82% of all U.S. funds trailed their respective benchmarks, according to the latest S&P Indices Versus Active funds scorecard. This was the first year that the analysis included 15 years of data, helping smooth out periods of volatility that can affect the performance of active managers. The results coincide with the rise of passive investing and a growing view among investors and financial advisers that active managers can’t pick stocks well enough to justify the fees they charge over extended periods and that even those managers who do outperform their passive counterparts can’t sustain it year after year.“We often hear from active managers, ‘You need to measure us over a longer-term cycle,’” said Aye Soe, managing director of research and design at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “Even over a full market cycle, which includes peaks and troughs, we still see the majority of active managers performing unfavorably against their benchmarks.”The debate over whether passive management is as good or better than active management is a long-running and contentious one, but it has heated up in recent years. Active managers’ struggles to beat the market over recent years amid a long-term bull market in stocks have resulted in fee pressure, fund closings, business overhauls and mergers. Investors have spoken with their wallets, turning to index-tracking funds in droves. Some $1.2 trillion has been withdrawn from actively managed U.S. stock funds since the start of 2007 through March, according to Morningstar Inc. Nearly the same amount, $1.1 trillion, has moved into passive U.S. stock funds over the same period. Index giant Vanguard Group pulled in a net $33 billion in February, $29.6 billion of which went into index products, and $40.5 billion in March, $35.5 billion of which went into index products, a spokeswoman said. Among more than a dozen categories tracked, 95.4% of U.S. mid-cap funds, 93.2% of U.S. small-cap funds and 92.2% of U.S. large-cap funds trailed their respective benchmarks, according to the data. The performance analysis, known as Spiva, is published semiannually by S&P Global using a methodology that includes funds that have been liquidated or merged out of existence. S&P Dow Jones Indices is a joint venture of S&P Global and CME Group Inc. It is a major participant in the indexing business with more than $2.1 trillion indexed to the S&P 500 index as of 2015. A committee composed of three representatives of S&P Dow Jones Indices and two representatives of The Wall Street Journal determine the composition of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Dow Jones & Co., a unit of News Corp , sold a majority stake in its index business in 2010 and sold the remaining stake in 2013.S&P Dow Jones Indices pulls performance data on active funds from a database maintained by the Center for Research in Security Prices, a research and learning center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The latest Spiva survey period ended during a year of geopolitical tumult of the sort that sometimes is thought to benefit active managers, with market-churning events including Britain’s vote to exit from the European Union and Donald Trump‘s surprise election to the U.S. presidency. Not even the volatility that came with those events was enough to give many more active fund managers the edge over indexes.S&P Dow Jones Indices found that 89.4% of U.S. mid-cap stock funds, 85.5% of small-cap funds and 66% of large-cap actively managed funds trailed their benchmarks in 2016. That came in a year in which stock markets performed well. The S&P 500 index delivered a total return of nearly 12% last year, while the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600 rose 20.7% and 26.6%, respectively.Even stock funds that manage to top the market for many years can stumble badly. One high-profile example is Sequoia Fund, operated by Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, a firm co-founded by William Ruane, a value investor and friend and mentor to famed investor Warren Buffett. Until the end of 2015, Sequoia Fund was the top performing large-cap growth mutual fund tracked by Morningstar over the previous 15 years, nearly doubling the annual performance of the S&P 500. But the fund was badly burned by a heavy position in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Valeant’s stock price has plunged 96% from its peak in August 2015 amid questions about its accounting practices. Steep losses in Valeant have left the fund near the bottom of all large-cap growth funds over the past one, three and five years. The fund’s return over the past five years is less than half of the S&P 500’s 13.9%. “We’re working very hard to restore the track record that our investors have come to expect from us,” said David Poppe, co-manager of the fund.

He was invited here by the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joe Dunford, who is on a routine visit to meet with U.S. and Iraqi commanders and troops.The visit comes as the Trump administration is assessing the U.S. strategy to combat Islamic State in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.According to a statement from Mr. Abadi’s office, the two sides discussed the battle in Mosul, international support for Iraq, as well as training and equipment issues. The U.S. delegation also met with Irfan al-Hayali, the defense minister, and Gen. Othman al-Ghanimi, the chief of staff of the Iraqi forces.They were joined in those meetings by Tom Bossert, a former administration official under President George W. Bush, now serving as Mr. Trump’s homeland security adviser. The men arrived midafternoon and proceeded to a number of back-to-back meetings with Iraqi and U.S. officials, including Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who is the commander of the coalition effort against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. “As well as receiving briefings and updates, Mr. Kushner is traveling on behalf of the president to express the president’s support and commitment to the government of Iraq and U.S. personnel currently engaged in the campaign,” said Capt. Greg Hicks, a spokesman for Gen. Dunford.Later in the evening, Messrs. Kushner, Bossert and Gen. Dunford dined with U.S. Ambassador Douglas Silliman at the sprawling U.S. embassy compound in Baghdad.Mr. Kushner, 36, a newcomer to foreign-policy issues, has taken an active role as an adviser to Mr. Trump on national security and foreign policy. Last month, Mr. Kushner made, for a White House official, a rare appearance at the Pentagon, where he met Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense Mohammed bin Salman during his meeting with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He has also been influential with his father-in-law on issues pertaining to Mexico and other countries, and he has been given broad authority by his father-in-law to attempt to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.Mr. Kushner, a multimillionaire businessman and developer interested in how technology can reform organizations, launched an innovation office for the White House last week that intends to help reform government.Mr. Kushner didn’t speak with reporters on the trip to Iraq, his first ever here, which was preceded by an overnight stay at a U.S. military base in Germany.Mr. Mattis and Gen. Dunford are completing a review of the strategy to fight the group. Mr. Trump signaled during the campaign and since assuming office that he had a plan to accelerate the fight against Islamic State, offering no details about what it might be.No plan has emerged, and it now falls to Mr. Mattis and Gen. Dunford to come up with a new strategy. Gen. Dunford declined to discuss what the new strategy would look like. But, according to numerous U.S. officials, the strategy may largely resemble the old one, initiated under President Barack Obama, with tweaks and additions in the margins, U.S. officials said.Gen. Dunford said he invited Messrs. Kushner and Bossert to join him on the trip some weeks ago so they could see the work troops are doing here, since they will be part of the decision on strategy.“I think anyone who’s involved in the discussion on where we go strategically—having good situational awareness about what’s happening tactically and hear it first hand and unfiltered, how our advisers assess the Iraqi security forces, both the opportunities and the challenges—will feed into somebody’s strategic view,” Gen. Dunford told reporters traveling with him on a military jet.The new strategy, or a refinement of it, may include additional U.S. troops for both Iraq and Syria, possible changes that could put American soldiers closer to the front lines, and an accelerated airstrike campaign. Under Mr. Obama last fall, the U.S. military had already been given additional authorities which essentially delegated decision making closer to the battlefield.The visit comes as American and Iraqi troops fight to evict Islamic State militants from the northern Iraqi city of Mosul and prepare for a fight against the group in Raqqa, its self-declared de facto capital in Syria. Meanwhile, the U.S. military is investigating a series of airstrikes in recent weeks that officials believe may be partly responsible for the deaths of scores of civilians in both Iraq and Syria. There was no new assessment from those investigations, Gen. Dunford said Sunday.—Ghassan Adnan in Baghdad contributed to this article.

      "text" : "President Trump is abandoning a number of his key campaign promises on economic policy, adopting instead many of the centrist positions he railed against while campaigning as a populist. Trump will not label China a “currency manipulator,” he told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, despite a campaign pledge that he would apply the label on his first day in office. He also said he was open to reappointing Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet L. Yellen after saying last year that the central banker should be “ashamed” of what she was doing to the country. And he embraced the Export-Import Bank, a government agency that he mocked last year and that has long been despised by conservatives who labeled it crony capitalism. The statements represent a move toward the economic policies of more centrist Republicans and even at times align with the approach of former president Barack Obama. Should he follow through on the newly articulated positions, it would suggest that the candidate who ran as the ultimate outsider is increasingly adopting a more moderate economic agenda. The reversals come amid a period of rapid evolution for Trump on both foreign and domestic issues. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Trump’s commitment to repealing the Affordable Care Act has wavered. On Wednesday, he said repealing the Affordable Care Act needed to be Congress’s main priority after scrapping the effort several weeks ago. On the global stage, Trump’s reversals have been even sharper. Last week, he ordered airstrikes against the Syrian military, even though he promised during the campaign to keep the United States out of conflicts in the Middle East. He is also adopting the Obama administration’s call to oust Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, a position he refused to take during the campaign. The shift on Syria enraged some of Trump’s campaign supporters who had embraced his isolationist foreign policy. Trump has also sharpened his criticism of Russia, a major break from the praise he lavished on Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign. Also on Wednesday, Trump praised the work of NATO, a pact between the United States and some of its closest allies that Trump once called “obsolete.” “It was once obsolete; it is no longer obsolete,” he said Wednesday after meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Trump’s changes are catching lawmakers, business executives, supporters, critics and even markets off guard. The U.S. dollar slumped and Treasury bond yields fell after the Wall Street Journal quoted Trump saying the dollar was too strong. The rapid shuffle of priorities comes as he adopts a growing number of centrist policies, many of which the Obama administration tried to advance amid heated GOP opposition for years. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) His decision not to label China a currency manipulator follows an explicit and repeated campaign vow to do so. But economists and even critics of China’s economic policy have said that while the country used to intervene to devalue its currency, it abandoned that practice years ago. It would have been embarrassing for Trump, in an upcoming currency report by the Treasury Department, to allege that the Chinese were engaged in a practice they had already stopped, these experts said. “Presidents, they get facts like the rest of us, and they should use them,” said Larry Kudlow, who was one of Trump’s top economic advisers during the campaign. Trump’s embrace of moderate positions also suggests a waning influence among the hard-line nationalist White House advisers who helped Trump win the election, as well as the rise of other advisers — many of whom hail from New York — who have more centrist, even left-leaning views. For example, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president who did not play a role during the campaign, has a rapidly growing portfolio within the White House, while Trump has marginalized the role of chief strategist and self-proclaimed economic nationalist Stephen K. Bannon in recent days. “Trump is walking a policy tightrope,” said Stephen Moore, who was a top economic adviser to Trump during the campaign. “A president of course has to adapt to changing circumstances, but he also has to honor his central campaign promises. Janet Yellen and Obamacare have to go.” Many of Trump’s new positions show his shift away from a populist platform embraced by the Republican Party’s most conservative members. For example, in 2015, he said the Export-Import Bank was not “necessary” because it mainly helped a few large companies that did not need assistance. The agency essentially offers financing support for companies that export goods overseas, helping many U.S. companies reach new markets. In the Wall Street Journal interview, Trump rejected his past thinking on this, saying that “lots of small companies are really helped” and that “it’s a very good thing.” Others have found his changes reassuring. Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow in the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution, said, “Boy, what a surprise to find that he’s moved so far.” “The president’s positions were ‘shoot from the hip,’ and, basically, I think the professional economists found it absurd,” Bosworth said. “To observe that he’s willing to move back towards a more rational policy, even while he’s being pushed in the opposite direction [by some advisers]. . . to me, it says the president listens to common sense. In that respect, I think it’s encouraging.” Trump’s new statements may not reflect a permanent change of view, as the president’s policies have been continually fluid since he entered politics. Trump has floated different ideas on how to pay for new infrastructure projects and how to rework the tax code, even though he is not committed to those ideas and the planning remains in flux. And despite his move toward more conventional policies, the president on Wednesday again demonstrated he is willing to defy many norms. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

See all newsletters Past presidents have typically refrained from commenting on the value of the dollar or the interest rate set by the Federal Reserve for fear of upsetting markets. Since the Clinton administration, the United States has adhered to a “strong dollar” policy in which leaders have defended the value of the currency. But Trump said Wednesday that confidence in his leadership was driving up the dollar’s value and that it could end up hurting the U.S. economy. A strong dollar makes it more expensive for other countries to buy U.S. manufactured goods, hurting U.S. companies. Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University, said it was striking that a sitting president would comment so directly on the value of the dollar. “It could also be taken as an implicit threat to other countries that if the dollar stays strong and if U.S. bilateral trade imbalances with its major trading partners stay high or continue to expand, that he will take some sort of action,” Prasad said. Yellen’s term expires Feb. 3, and Trump will have the opportunity to replace her. She was nominated to her job by Obama and confirmed in 2014. Many conservatives consider Yellen too hesitant to raise interest rates, saying she is too focused on boosting workers’ wages at the expense of controlling inflation. But Trump said he liked low interest rates and that he had not made a decision about whether to reappoint her. “I like her; I respect her,” he said. “It’s very early.”",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — President Drumpf promised on Friday that he would unveil a “massive” tax cut for Americans next week, vowing a “big announcement on Wednesday,” but he revealed no details about what is certain to be an enormously complicated effort to overhaul the nation’s tax code.Mr. Drumpf offered his tax tease in an interview and again during remarks at the Treasury Department on Friday afternoon as he raced to stack up legislative accomplishments before his 100th day in office at the end of next week.His announcement surprised Capitol Hill and left Mr. Drumpf’s own Treasury officials speechless as he arrived at the Treasury offices to sign directives to roll back Obama-era tax rules and financial regulations. Earlier in the day, when reporters asked Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, how far away a tax overhaul proposal was, he said he could not give an answer. “Tax reform is way too complicated,” he said.Mr. Drumpf told The Associated Press in the interview that his tax reductions would be “bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever.” But he faces an enormous fight among clashing vested interests as Congress tries to rewrite the tax code.Starting that fight next week is further complicated by Mr. Drumpf’s hopes to revive the Republican health care plan that collapsed last month. And it would mean trying a tax overhaul as his White House faces the prospect of a government shutdown if lawmakers cannot agree on a funding bill by April 28.The details of Mr. Drumpf’s tax plans remain the subject of intense speculation, with stock markets regularly gyrating when White House officials discuss the subject. Since taking office, the president has suggested that he wants to enact the deepest cuts to individual and corporate tax rates in history.But despite Mr. Drumpf’s statement on Friday that his tax overhaul “really formally begins on Wednesday,” White House officials quickly cautioned against high expectations that Mr. Drumpf would provide the legislative text of a detailed tax plan next week.Instead, a senior administration official said the president would release only the “parameters” that Mr. Drumpf expected a tax plan to follow in the long congressional debate that would surely follow. Another official said the information released next week would be more like a “broad” outline. Wall Street, which tends to celebrate tax cuts, barely reacted; the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 0.3 percent Friday.The administration has maintained that middle-income tax cuts, a simplification of personal income taxes, and making business taxes more competitive with other countries are the top priorities. Mr. Drumpf insisted that his plans were on track and that his strategy to remake the economy would change history.“This is really the beginning of a whole new way of life that this country hasn’t seen in many, many years,” Mr. Drumpf said as he sat at the desk of Mr. Mnuchin, near a portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary.He said, “We’ve lifted one terrible regulation after another at a record clip from the energy sector to the auto sector.”Despite Mr. Drumpf’s enthusiasm, the directives he signed at the Treasury Department on Friday to review measures put in place by the Obama administration were largely preliminary. As business groups cheered the moves, some skeptics were left questioning whether Mr. Drumpf was keeping his campaign promises to give working-class Americans a higher priority than Wall Street bankers.“From our perspective, it is a direction that is dramatically backwards on financial stability,” said Lisa Donner, executive director of Americans for Financial Reform.The presidential order asks Mr. Mnuchin to review the tax regulations imposed by President Barack Obama in 2016. Those include efforts to clamp down on “corporate inversions” — in which American companies merge with foreign companies to take advantage of lower tax rates abroad.Viewed alone, undoing the rules would appear to be at odds with Mr. Drumpf’s campaign pledge to reduce incentives for companies to move overseas to minimize taxes.Last year Mr. Obama’s Treasury Department, concerned about Pfizer’s $152 billion bid to acquire Allergan, which makes Botox, issued rules to thwart the practice. Among those efforts were regulations to prevent moves like “earnings-stripping,” in which an American subsidiary borrows from a parent company and uses the interest payments on the loans to offset its earnings. It was intended to make the financial relocations less attractive.The uproar over inversions dogged a number of transactions over the last five years including Burger King’s takeover of the Canadian chain Tim Hortons and the drug maker AbbVie’s planned acquisition of an Irish rival, Shire.But the major target of the outrage was the Pfizer-Allergan deal, by far the biggest effort by a company to give up its American citizenship to cut its taxes. Pfizer executives braced themselves for opposition from the Obama administration — but were surprised by how aggressively the White House fought the deal. Within a few months, Pfizer and Allergan surrendered and ended their agreement.Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant, said reversing these rules would be a gift to Wall Street bankers and lawyers who have complained that they have hampered international deal making.“They’ll be dancing in the streets and jumping for joy,” Mr. Willens said.Memorandums with the executive order ask Mr. Mnuchin to review the Orderly Liquidation Authority, a tool created by the Dodd-Frank law of 2010 for unwinding financial institutions that are on the verge of collapse. Many banks have hoped that Congress will repeal the system. The administration is examining whether it encourages excessive risk-taking or exposes taxpayers to potential liabilities.The Treasury is also reviewing the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which designates financial institutions as “systemically important,” better known as “too big to fail.” It requires them to hold more capital in reserve in the event of financial emergencies.Both provisions, which were part of the Dodd-Frank law, are delayed by a 180-day review by the Treasury.Democrats warned that Mr. Drumpf was putting vulnerable middle-class Americans in danger. “Simply eliminating these regulations and putting nothing in their place leaves a hole in the tax system that sophisticated corporations will continue to take advantage of, to the detriment of the country,” said David Kamin, a New York University law professor who worked on the Obama administration’s National Economic Council.Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, assailed Mr. Drumpf for trying to undermine rules that were put in place to protect the economy. “Any actions to undermine these protections encourage Wall Street’s risky behavior and leave taxpayers and our economy exposed to another catastrophe,” he said.Mr. Brown said that Mr. Drumpf appeared to be breaking a campaign promise by making it easier for companies to use inversions. “We should be working to lower taxes for hardworking families and workers across Ohio, not helping multimillion-dollar corporations cheat the system to avoid paying their fair share,” he said.Mr. Mnuchin insisted that would not be the case and argued the tax overhaul legislation plan that they would propose will address the problem of companies moving overseas.Mr. Drumpf has shown an affinity for tariffs. He proposed a “reciprocal” tax this month that matches the import taxes other countries impose on American goods.It remains unclear if Mr. Drumpf is on board with the “border adjustment” tax that is central to the plan being promoted by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and House Republicans. The concept would allow Republicans to raise more than $1 trillion of revenue, making it possible for them pass legislation without adding to the deficit.Mr. Drumpf has been cool to that plan in interviews, and recently his advisers have been making the case that a surging economy, rather than Mr. Ryan’s border adjustment tax, will pay for deep rate cuts.“The plan will pay for itself with growth,” Mr. Mnuchin said an Institute for International Finance conference on Thursday.Mr. Drumpf’s economic team had initially set an August deadline to get tax legislation passed, but that target was delayed to the end of the year after Republicans expended time on their failed health plan.After The Associated Press reported on Mr. Drumpf’s accelerated timeline to put out their tax plan, Treasury officials who were awaiting Mr. Drumpf’s visit to their office smiled broadly and chuckled nervously as they digested news on their smartphones.But during his visit, Mr. Drumpf expressed confidence that Mr. Mnuchin and his team were ready to move on a tax overhaul, a mammoth legislative undertaking that has not occurred since 1986. After a brief tour of the building, Mr. Drumpf praised his Treasury secretary’s financial acumen and said he was sure that Mr. Mnuchin would be among the best to do the job.“I think Hamilton is tough to beat, but maybe you can do that too,” Mr. Drumpf said.",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-made-charles-murphy-successful-and-rich-but-happiness-eluded-him-1491764063 Charles Murphy used to walk home through New York City’s Central Park to his 19-room townhouse for dinner with his family. Last year, he began voicing worries about money to his boss, hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson, who often joined him along the way.At 56 years old, Mr. Murphy had a net worth in the tens of millions of dollars. He entered Columbia University at 16 and later earned law and business degrees at Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On Wall Street, he had a ringside seat to some of the biggest financial events of the past 20 years, from the​1990s merger boom to the dot-com bust to the Bernard Madoff scandal and the travails of American International Group Inc. He made millions of dollars at banks and investment firms in New York and London, despite his share of setbacks. During those walks, though, Mr. Paulson found himself trying to reassure Mr. Murphy, according to a person who knew both men, offering reminders of all he had accomplished. “You don’t need to worry,” Mr. Paulson would say.Mr. Murphy was blessed with a commanding presence and boundless ambition. Yet his concerns over maintaining the life he had created for himself, his wife, Annabella, and their three young sons consumed him. The very qualities that helped him build a fortune were no match for his fear of losing it. “In his mind, he had worries,” said Belén Hormaeche, a close friend of Mr. Murphy and his wife. “But it was all in his mind.”Mr. Paulson, who eulogized Mr. Murphy last Monday, sought to explain his apparent suicide to friends and family during a funeral service in New York. “The mind can play tricks with oneself, distorting reality,” Mr. Paulson said. “No matter how much those close to him tried to help, and no one tried more than Annabella, Charles could not see a path forward…his mind created a trap from which he couldn’t escape.”This account of Mr. Murphy’s life and death is based on interviews with close friends and colleagues, as well as those familiar with his family.Born to a middle-class New York family in 1961, Mr. Murphy stood out at a young age for his drive and intellect. His father worked as an engineer for a utility company and sparked his son’s early interest in books and classical music. The family lived in a modest Upper East Side walk-up apartment.Mr. Murphy attended Stuyvesant High School, one of New York City’s top public schools, before enrolling at Columbia. At 6 feet 6 inches tall, he became captain of the crew team. Out of the water, he discussed philosophy, poetry and arts, classmates recalled.Mr. Murphy became interested in investment banking while pursuing advanced degrees at Harvard and MIT, said Tom Seeman, a Harvard classmate.In 1985, he was recruited by Goldman Sachs Group . Inc., embarking on a two-decade career at the world’s biggest banks including Morgan Stanley , Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG .Mr. Murphy spent most of that time in London, where he was seen as polished and articulate, favoring expensive suits. He closed complicated deals involving insurance companies and won praise for his financial analysis. He could also be rigid in his point of view, and disregarded opposing ideas, colleagues said. Some who worked with Mr. Murphy recalled times when he retreated into his office and closed the door, wanting to be left alone for days. That’s how he focused at work, said someone close to the family. ‘No matter how much those close to him tried to help, and no one tried more than Annabella, Charles could not see a path forward…his mind created a trap from which he couldn’t escape.’ In 1993, he married Heather O’Brien, a 24-year-old American preparing to start doctoral studies in theology, according to a wedding announcement. Six years later, after the couple had two children, the marriage collapsed. Ms. Murphy later married Sol Kerzner, a South African hotel magnate.After the breakup of his marriage, Mr. Murphy became a fixture in London’s club scene, colleagues said. In 2004, Mr. Murphy married a young Londoner, Annabella Demetriou, and became devoted to her, friends said. In 2006, he threw her a lavish 30th birthday party in London featured in Tatler magazine.In the late 1990s, he became excited about the chance for bigger rewards outside Wall Street. At the height of the internet-stock frenzy, Mr. Murphy quit Morgan Stanley to become chief financial officer of a London startup, Antfactory Holdings Ltd. The firm backed technology companies and eyed a lucrative initial public offering itself.Mr. Murphy accepted a token salary and was given stock with the potential to be worth tens of millions of dollars if the company went public or was sold. Within 18 months of his move, internet stocks had crashed, ending Antfactory’s ambitions.Mr. Murphy got another chance at a potentially lucrative IPO in 2007. Fairfield Greenwich Group, a Connecticut firm that managed $15 billion for wealthy individuals investing in hedge funds, considered going public. Mr. Murphy was hired to oversee its strategy. As his family prepared to move to the U.S. from London, Mr. Murphy paid $33 million for the seven-level, 11-fireplace, limestone Upper East Side townhouse of Matthew Bronfman, an heir to the Seagram liquor fortune.The Fairfield Greenwich IPO never happened. The firm had channeled billions of dollars of its investors’ money into a fund overseen by Mr. Madoff, whose giant Ponzi scheme was uncovered in 2008. Mr. Murphy was out of a job. He tried to sell his house in 2009 as he and his wife considered moving back to London.By chance, Mr. Murphy and his wife were invited to a dinner party at a friend’s East Side home, where he struck up a conversation with Mr. Paulson, of Paulson & Co. Mr. Paulson had just made $20 billion betting against mortgage securities and banks in what was considered one of the great trades in financial history. Now, he wanted to invest in insurance companies. Mr. Murphy knew how, and he was eventually hired for the job.One of Mr. Murphy’s early ideas was to invest $80 million to help recapitalize struggling insurer Conseco Inc. The deal earned Paulson & Co. more than $100 million.More recently, in search of another lucrative trade, Mr. Murphy asked another hedge-fund investor: “What can we do that’s bigger?”The answer seemed to be AIG, the insurer that in 2008 required a nearly $185 billion U.S.-funded bailout. The company had repaid taxpayers by 2012, and management was focused on improving its financial performance. In March 2015, Messrs. Murphy and Paulson met with AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock and offered a different plan: break up the insurance conglomerate. AIG resisted. Mr. Murphy spent months pitching his proposal to hedge funds and eventually persuaded billionaire Carl Icahn, who was already eyeing AIG.“I didn’t know him well,” Mr. Icahn said, “but in our meetings I found him to be very bright and knowledgeable, and I liked him.” Mr. Murphy lobbied Wall Street analysts to write research in support of the plan. Some analysts said their conversations with Mr. Murphy amounted to lectures. A half-hour on the phone with Mr. Murphy was “29 minutes of Charles talking,” one said. People who challenged the AIG breakup recall being barraged by Mr. Murphy with an avalanche of facts and figures.At an AIG investor meeting hosted by Mr. Hancock in November 2015, Mr. Murphy repeatedly interrupted Mr. Hancock as the chief executive tried to answer investors’ questions, some of the attendees said.“Most investors are polite and deferential to management,” said former Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Josh Stirling. “He was definitely confrontational.”The following February, AIG offered Messrs. Icahn and Paulson board seats to avert a proxy fight. Mr. Paulson suggested Mr. Murphy take his spot but AIG demanded someone else. The reason, according to people familiar with the matter: Directors felt Mr. Murphy was too abrasive.In the fourth quarter, Paulson sold nearly half of its AIG position, locking in double-digit gains from the stock’s improvement in 2016. Mr. Murphy made several million dollars a year at Paulson, a person close to the matter said. His compensation had been rising in recent years, though the firm performed poorly of late.People around Mr. Murphy told him he needn’t worry about money, but he worried nonetheless. Mr. Murphy had a $12 million mortgage on his Upper East Side home, according to public records. Two of his youngest children attended private schools; two more from his first marriage were in college.Early in 2016, he put his townhouse on the market for $49.5 million. By summer, the price had dropped to $42.5 million.Around July of last year, some of Mr. Murphy’s friends and family saw a change. He looked tired. Instead of leading conversations, he was withdrawn, seemingly lost in thought. ‘When I asked him how things were going, he would say, ‘OK,’ or, ‘Not so well,’ when in the past he would always be more expansive.’ Making even minor decisions, whether to go to the beach or take a walk, unsettled Mr. Murphy. His wife brought him to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with depression, prescribed medications and closely monitored him, friends said.Mrs. Murphy tried to draw her husband out of his shell. “Charles, what do you think?” she asked him during a dinner a few months ago with friends. Mr. Murphy smiled and made an effort to join the conversation, a friend recalled.Mr. Seeman, the former Harvard classmate, would see Mr. Murphy when he visited New York City. In the past few months, he said, Mr. Murphy began putting off his requests to meet: “When I asked him how things were going, he would say, ‘OK,’ or, ‘Not so well,’ when in the past he would always be more expansive.” The Paulson firm has lost money so far in 2017, according to an investor. In February, AIG’s shares fell on setbacks in its turnaround plan, though they remain above Paulson’s purchase price.Mr. Murphy confided to a rival hedge-fund investor it had become more difficult for him to find attractive investments in a rising stock market. A few weeks ago, Mr. Murphy had lunch with an old friend and said he was depressed and seeing a doctor. On Feb. 21, Mr. Murphy added his wife as a co-owner of their Upper East Side home, according to public records. That month, the asking price for the house was listed as $36.5 million.In recent weeks, Mr. Murphy spoke with colleagues at Paulson about new investment opportunities, showing signs of renewed enthusiasm. He and his family celebrated Mr. Murphy’s birthday on a ski trip in Vail, Colo., which seemed to buoy his spirits.A friend staying at the same resort recalled fondly the sight of Mr. Murphy guiding one of his sons down the bunny slope, the father’s long legs stretched around the boy’s skis.Flying home on Sunday, March 26, Mrs. Murphy told a friend that her husband had a “great week” and that the holiday was “fabulous.”The next day, Mr. Murphy sat down for breakfast with his wife and children. As he left for work, the nanny took notice of Mr. Murphy’s suit and crisp shirt.“You look good,” she said, according to a close family friend.“I feel great,” Mr. Murphy responded.That morning, Mr. Murphy worked in Paulson’s Midtown Manhattan office. Later, he headed to the Sofitel New York hotel a few blocks away, checked into a room and jumped from the 24th floor.

      "text" : "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The White House announced on Friday that it will cut off public access to visitor logs revealing who is entering the White House complex and shut down a disclosure website containing a wide range of government data. The decision breaks with past practice and returns a cloak of secrecy over the basic day-to-day workings of the administration.The decision reverses a move by the Obama administration, which released more than six million White House visitor records, even as it fought successfully in federal court to keep some of the information secret. It followed months of speculation over how President Drumpf, who has rejected basic standards of presidential transparency — including the release of his tax returns — would handle the matter of revealing who comes and goes at the White House.White House officials, conceding privately that the decision would be controversial, said the visitor logs were being withheld for national security reasons. They said they were relying on the same legal rationale espoused by the Obama administration in arguing that many of the records were essentially “presidential records,” and therefore not subject to public disclosure.“Given the grave national security risks and privacy concerns of the hundreds of thousands of visitors annually, the White House Office will disclose Secret Service logs as outlined under the Freedom of Information Act, a position the Obama White House successfully defended in federal court,” said Mike Dubke, the White House communications director.The new policy drew scathing criticism from government watchdog groups, which said it was the latest example of Mr. Drumpf trying to shield his activities and those of his administration from public view.“From dismissing decades of tradition by declining to release his tax returns to refusing to place his assets in a blind trust, President Drumpf seems to be going out of his way to fan distrust and doubt about the way his White House works,” said Meredith McGehee, the chief of policy at Issue One, a group that campaigns to reduce the influence of money in politics.Although a federal court ruled in 2011 that the visitor logs could be kept secret, the Obama administration voluntarily provided many of the records.Lawyers still exercised what they maintained was a right to omit some entries from the logs, in the cases of confidential meetings such as interviews for prospective Supreme Court candidates. And the Obamas left out the names of celebrities and top donors who came to personal events at the White House, such as star-studded birthday celebrations for the president and his wife.The Drumpf policy effectively means that none of the White House visitor logs will be available for at least five years. Under the Presidential Records Act, the public can gain access to presidential records starting five years after the end of an administration, although the president may seek to keep them secret for up to 12 years.The White House also said it was ending the contract for open.whitehouse.gov, the government disclosure site that contains the visitor log data as well as financial disclosure and salary information for White House employees. The information is available elsewhere, the White House said, calling the site a waste of taxpayer money. Ending it would save $70,000 by 2020, it said.",

      "text" : "Story highlightsNew report says United States failed to do its \"homework\" before airstrikes on civiliansSyrian reports say mosque hit; US says al Qaeda meeting targeted (CNN)A new report suggests American forces failed to take necessary precautions to avoid dropping a pair of bombs on a Northern Syria mosque full of hundreds of worshipers.Syrians said the US airstrikes hit a western Aleppo mosque on March 16, killing at least 40 worshipers and injuring dozens more. The US said the bombings targeted a meeting hall hosting al Qaeda terrorists.Interviews with locals and photographs and video of the building in question prove it was a well-known mosque that hosted lectures every Thursday between sunset and evening prayers, according to a new Human Rights Watch report. Syria Civil Defense volunteers dig through rubble after a reported airstrike Thursday on al-Jena, Syria.Any attempt to gather information about the building would have revealed that it was a popular gathering spot for residents at the time of the intended attack, Human Rights Watch said. Furthermore, the investigation found no evidence to support the US claim that members of al Qaeda or any other armed group were meeting in the mosque, the report said. \"The US seems to have gotten several things fundamentally wrong in this attack, and dozens of civilians paid the price,\" Ole Solvang, deputy emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \"The US authorities need to figure out what went wrong, start doing their homework before they launch attacks, and make sure it doesn't happen again.\"Read MoreThe US military said in March that an airstrike killed \"several terrorists\" at a meeting location of senior al Qaeda terrorists in Idlib. A US military official confirmed to CNN that American warplanes conducted airstrikes in the area. But the official said the strikes hit a building 40 to 50 feet from the mosque, and said satellite imagery showed the mosque still standing. But the Human Rights Watch report said the US military misidentified the location of the attack, and that it was southwest of al-Jinah, not in Idlib.The attack was documented by UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Syria Civil Defense, better known as the White Helmets. Human Rights Watch interviewed a member of the White Helmets who was on the ground for the report, as well as four people who were in the building during the strikes.Using research from open source investigative group Bellingcat, which analyzed video footage and photographs from the attack, and Forensic Architecture, which created models of the mosque and a reconstruction of the attack, Human Rights Watch said it was able to corroborate claims that the building was a mosque.The locations of two large craters suggest the first bomb hit the mosque during prayers, sending survivors fleeing before a second blast hit people outside. Others who rushed to the scene to help also were killed, a witness told Human Rights Watch.Photos of the building before the attack show it had shelves for shoes and rugs for prayers, suggesting it was a mosque, the report said. Furthermore, a photo taken of the building after the attack shows a sign amid the rubble that reads \"Saydina Omar ibn Al-Khattab Mosque.\" /* global CNN, Modernizr */'use strict';CNN.INJECTOR.executeFeature('video').then(function () {CNN.VideoPlayer.handleUnmutePlayer = function handleUnmutePlayer(containerId, dataObj) {'use strict';var playerPropertyObj,rememberTime,unmuteCTA,unmuteIdSelector = 'unmute_' + containerId,isPlayerMute;dataObj = dataObj || {};isPlayerMute = (typeof dataObj.muted === 'boolean') ? dataObj.muted : false;if (CNN.VideoPlayer.playerProperties && CNN.VideoPlayer.playerProperties[containerId]) if (playerPropertyObj.mute && playerPropertyObj.contentPlayed) };CNN.VideoPlayer.showFlashSlate = function showFlashSlate(container) ;CNN.autoPlayVideoExist = (CNN.autoPlayVideoExist === true) ? true : false;var configObj = ,autoStartVideo = false,callbackObj,containerEl,currentVideoCollection = [],currentVideoCollectionId = '',isLivePlayer = false,moveToNextTimeout,mutePlayerEnabled = false,nextVideoId = '',nextVideoUrl = '',turnOnFlashMessaging = false,videoPinner,videoEndSlateImpl;if (CNN.autoPlayVideoExist === false) configObj.autostart = autoStartVideo;CNN.VideoPlayer.setPlayerProperties(configObj.markupId, autoStartVideo, isLivePlayer, mutePlayerEnabled);CNN.VideoPlayer.setFirstVideoInCollection(currentVideoCollection, configObj.markupId);videoEndSlateImpl = new CNN.VideoEndSlate('body-text_16');/*** Finds the next video ID and URL in the current collection, if available.* @param currentVideoId The video that is currently playing* @param containerId The parent container Id of the video element*/function findNextVideo(currentVideoId) findNextVideo('tv/2017/03/15/intv-amanpour-john-mccain-syria-trump.cnn');/*** Navigates to the video leaf page of the next video in the current collection, if available.* @param currentVideoId The video that is currently playing* @param containerId The parent container Id of the video element*/function navigateToNextVideo(currentVideoId, containerId) callbackObj = ;if (typeof configObj.context !== 'string' || configObj.context.length  0) CNN.autoPlayVideoExist = (CNN.autoPlayVideoExist === true) ? true : false;CNN.VideoPlayer.getLibrary(configObj, callbackObj, isLivePlayer);});/* videodemanddust is a default feature of the injector */CNN.INJECTOR.scriptComplete('videodemanddust');JUST WATCHEDMcCain: 'More latitude' for commanders in SyriaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMcCain: 'More latitude' for commanders in Syria 07:57The report calls on US authorities to make public findings of an investigation into the strikes, provide \"adequate redress\" to civilian victims and their families, and hold those responsible for the attack accountable.The United States has targeted al Qaeda fighters in Syria in past strikes.

      "text" : "Despite pressure from the White House, House GOP leaders determined Thursday night that they didn’t have the votes to pass a rewrite of the Affordable Care Act and would not seek to put their proposal on the floor on Friday. A late push to act on health care had threatened the bipartisan deal to keep the government open for one week while lawmakers crafted a longer-term spending deal. Now, members are likely to approve the short-term spending bill when it comes to the floor and keep the government open past midnight on Friday. The failure of Republicans to unite behind the new health-care measure was a blow to White House officials, who were eager to see a vote ahead of President Trump’s 100-day mark. Congressional leaders were more focused this week on securing a spending agreement, according to multiple people involved in the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to talk publicly. It was also evidence of just how divided Republicans are about how to overhaul Obamacare, despite seven years of GOP promises to repeal and replace the 2010 law. Conservatives and moderates have repeatedly clashed over the contours of such a revamp, most sharply over bringing down insurance premiums in exchange for limiting the kind of coverage that is required to be offered. As many as 15 or so House Republicans have publicly said they will not support the latest GOP proposal, which was crafted among the White House, the hard-line House Freedom Caucus and a leading moderate lawmaker. That leaves House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and the White House an incredibly narrow path for passage. The speaker can lose only 22 Republicans on a health-care vote because Democrats have fiercely opposed any attempt to repeal the ACA. Will the federal government avoid a shutdown? Embed Copy Share Play Video1:53 (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The federal government will shut down unless Congress passes a bill by midnight on April 28. The Fix's Amber Phillips explains why a government shutdown is unlikely this time. Will the federal government avoid a shutdown? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Exiting a roughly 90-minute meeting in Ryan’s office late Thursday night, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said there would be no health-care vote Friday and that the main focus of the impromptu huddle was to ensure that the leadership had the votes to pass the one-week funding bill. “We are not voting on health-care tomorrow,” McCarthy said Thursday, denying that leaders had ever wanted to vote by Friday. “We’re still educating members,” McCarthy said, adding: “We’ve been making great progress. As soon as we have the votes, we’ll vote on it.” Trump weighed in on the spending negotiations on Thursday, tweeting that Democrats wanted to shut down the government to “bail out insurance companies.” “As families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks — Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government. Terrible!” Trump tweeted. But the failure to make progress on health care is a good sign for smooth passage of the government funding bill — at least the version that will keep the government’s lights on through May 5. Lawmakers are still finishing negotiations on a longer-term spending deal to fund the government through September. Republicans have stated that they need Democratic support to pass that measure, which they expect to consider next week. The Senate stands ready to approve the one-week spending bill, but only once the broader spending agreement is complete. Senators in both parties told reporters they were instructed not to leave Washington on Thursday night. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Thursday blocked a measure to allow the Senate to approve the stopgap budget without a formal vote. He has indicated that he will drop his objections once he is assured that a long-term budget agreement is in place, according to Senate Democratic aides. “Instead of rushing through health care,” Schumer told reporters, “they first ought to get the government funded for a full year — plain and simple.” The White House tried to jump-start talks on health care after House Republicans failed to pass a previous attempt at an ACA rewrite at the end of March. But Democrats fiercely oppose any effort to repeal the ACA and threatened to pull their support from the short-term bill if Republicans moved forward with that effort. “If Republicans pursue this partisan path of forcing Americans to pay more for less and destabilizing our county’s health-care system,” said House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), then “Republicans should be prepared to [keep the government open] on their own.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told a meeting of Democratic whips on Thursday that she had called Ryan and told him there were two conditions for Democratic support of the short-term funding bill, according to aides in the room. Democrats would only sign off on the emergency spending measure to allow lawmakers time to pass the longer-term spending deal, and they would not back the measure if doing so would allow Ryan time to set up a vote on a GOP rewrite of the Affordable Care Act. The sudden turmoil was yet another sign of Congress’s inability to meet deadlines for its most basic function: keeping the government’s lights on. And it presages fights among Congress, the White House and both parties over spending priorities, despite the one-party rule that gave some observers hope that the gridlock would cease. But it was Republicans who this week jettisoned money for Trump’s border wall because of widespread agreement that it should not be tied to the spending deal. Trump has also agreed to pay the cost-sharing subsidies for low-income people who get their insurance under the ACA — something he threatened to withhold if he did not get money for the wall. Ryan on Thursday also blamed Democrats for “dragging their feet” on negotiations in an apparent preparation to blame Democrats if their deal falls through. “I would be shocked if they would want to see a government shutdown, that the Democrats would want to do that,” Ryan told reporters at his weekly press briefing. “The reason this government funding bill is not ready is because Democrats have been dragging their feet.” The standoff is the first in what could be several budget battles between Congress and the White House this year. Trump has called for massive hikes to defense spending and harsh cuts to domestic agencies in his 2018 budget, a proposal that many Republicans have rejected out of hand. He is also likely to revive calls for money to begin constructing the border wall — which by some estimates would cost as much as $21 billion — in future budget negotiations. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) were forced to negotiate with Democrats on the budget after it became clear that Republicans lacked enough votes to pass a long-term spending bill on their own. As a result, the GOP leaders have had the uncomfortable task of writing a measure that ignores nearly all of Trump’s priorities, including money for the border wall. powerpost false endOfArticle true The Daily 202 newsletter A must-read morning briefing for decision-makers.

See all newsletters Schumer also sought to refocus blame on the GOP, arguing that the only thing standing in the way of a long-term agreement was Trump himself. Congressional leaders were nearing a final deal several weeks ago, but the talks were derailed when Office of Management and budget director Mick Mulvaney announced that Trump would demand that money for the border wall be included in the funding bill. “Unfortunately the president stood in the way for quite a long time,” Schumer said. “That’s why we’re a little delayed.” Congressional leaders had hoped to finalize a spending deal by midweek, but the talks were stuck on a small number of unrelated policy provisions, known as riders. Democrats complained that GOP leaders were trying to use the spending bill to cut abortion access and scale back Wall Street reforms passed under President Barack Obama.

Ask me your questions on the voicemail of the Dear Prudence podcast. Just leave a message at 401-371-DEAR (3327), and you may hear your question answered on a future episode of the show. Dear Prudence, My wife and I were elated to find out we are going to have a daughter! We decided to discuss names last week and gave ourselves three days to prepare our ideas. I spent a ton of time on this and even put together a presentation with each name and the reasons I liked them. I chose some important family names and some special names from literature and the arts—all of which I think would be beautiful. My wife showed up with a few names scribbled on the back of a grocery list as if she hardly even cared! Also her ideas were trashy misspelled names like Lauryn and Bethonie and 18th-century presidents’ names like Madison, Taylor, and Polk. I was so disappointed in my wife for not taking this seriously, as I feel it is very important. Honestly, this episode has me questioning the foundation of our relationship, let alone raising a child together. Obviously, I can’t just leave now because I am committed to the child, but how can my wife and I get past this major red flag in our relationship? I have tried to discuss it with her and she doesn’t even think she has done anything wrong, so we are at a major impasse. Subscribe to Prudie! —Baby Name Blow-Up I have good news for you, which is that your wife’s behavior is not anywhere near the neighborhood of red-flaggery, and after you’ve recovered from the initial shock conveyed in your letter, I hope you’ll agree. It’s not even in yellow-flag territory. You don’t mention that your wife seems indifferent at the prospect of having a daughter, or that she’s talked about child-rearing techniques that strike you as negligent or unsafe. Most parents-to-be don’t develop PowerPoints for possible baby names, and the fact that your wife didn’t write an essay for each of her ideas is not an indication that she’s going to make a lousy parent or that she’s less excited than you about having a child. For my own well-being, I’ll assume you were joking or exaggerating about having contemplated, even for a minute, ending an otherwise loving marriage because your wife thinks “Bethonie” is a cute name. Advertisement As for what makes a good name, more broadly, “trashy” and “misspelled” are highly subjective categories. “Lauren” used to be a boy’s name; that doesn’t mean naming a girl Lauren today is somehow “less correct,” and “Lauryn” is a plausible variation on the standard spelling of the name. If you don’t like her suggestions, you can say, “I don’t like the name Taylor” without resorting to, “How disgusting for our child to share her name with someone who only made it a year into his term before dying from drinking too much iced milk.” I guarantee you that there is at least someone out there who considers your “special literary names” to be affected and not nearly as unique as you think they are. “This is our daughter, Bartleby the Scrivener” may have a nice ring to you but won’t to everyone. “This is our daughter, Fragonard’s The Swing,” or “This is our daughter, Enfield Tennis Academy,” is not inherently better than “This is our daughter, Lauryn.” The takeaway here is not to get attached to the delusion that your taste is objectively good and your wife’s taste is objectively bad, about names or anything. Apologize to your wife profusely for your unkind overreaction, then have another brainstorming session—have several—and try to bring a great deal more generosity of spirit and open-mindedness to the process. * * * Dear Prudence, During my best friend L’s last two years of life, her brain cancer made her volatile and often unkind. I made a promise to her that I would look out for her socially isolated sister. Whenever I check in on her sister K, she blames me for not being a better friend to L while she was alive. I would have never promised to look out for K if I didn’t intend to follow through. I want to be a person who keeps her promises; I understand that K is probably in the anger stage of grief and hope to rise above. I put myself second during L’s last years, which took their toll on me. My friends say my promise didn’t include causing myself emotional trauma. K has little insight, poor communication skills, and is emotionally closed off, so talking to her hasn’t worked. Any thoughts? Advertisement —Drama Beyond the Grave You offered to “look out” for K, but that doesn’t mean you have to subject yourself to cruel accusations about how you treated your dead friend, nor does it mean you are singly responsible for K to learn how to speak to others with kindness and respect. From now on, make that a precondition of all your interactions with K. Say “I loved your sister and I was there for her as she was dying. It’s not OK for you to tell me I wasn’t a ‘good enough friend’ to her.” If she brings it up again, leave. You’ve tried to do your best for your friend’s sister, and you’ve already explained (repeatedly, from the sound of it) how her behavior is hurting you; at a certain point, trying to force yourself to continue in this friendship goes beyond fulfilling your original promise and becomes an exercise in self-flagellation. Think of it this way: In a way, you are looking out for K by refusing to allow her to demean and berate you, thereby demonstrating that all relationships, however casual, must be founded on basic respect and civility. * * * Dear Prudence, Multiple people in my life have a habit that drives me nuts, and I can’t tell if I’m being too sensitive. Whenever I do something they think is remotely odd, they laugh and ask “Why are you doing that?” and mock me for doing something “weird.” It’s always something benign, like getting iced coffee instead of hot, holding my purse the “wrong” way, or even glancing at something. I feel on edge and forced to explain (“This is just how I hold my purse”) and whatever answer I give gets another laugh. I don’t mind joking around about myself, but it doesn’t really come across as joking around. I’ve tried replying dryly with “Why do you care?” but then I come across as hostile. Am I overreacting? These people are not all from the same friend group, so I wonder if it’s just me. Advertisement —Fun or Relentless? Since this response comes from multiple people with no connection to one another, and generally revolves around innocuous little quirks, I think it’s likely that your friends are not trying to put you down or hurt your feelings. They don’t see themselves as demanding an explanation for some perceived lapse in “correct” behavior so much as genuinely curious about the habit in question. It’s also possible your friends are just joshing you in a spirit of non-judgmental friendliness, in which case they may see your explanations as further excuses to escalate said joshery. Getting iced coffee (even if it’s already cold out) is a matter of taste, not objectively odd behavior. Feel free to defend your quirks! But it may even be more effective not to defend your quirks, which make up who you are: shrugging or laughing the moment off may be all that’s needed to get back to the rest of the business of being friends, especially since there’s definitely a realm of normal social behavior wherein friends sometimes call one another weird, and expect to be called weird in turn. But if you truly find their teasing observations hurtful, it’s fine to ask them to stop without worrying if “it’s just you.” Even if it is just you, it’s perfectly fine to tell a friend that something they see as neutral or even light-hearted actually bothers you. A good friend will cheerfully apologize and do their best to knock it off. Feel free to ask them to check their behavior while making it clear you’re not assigning malice as a motivator: “You may not have noticed this, but sometimes you’ll point out little quirks of mine and I’d rather you don’t tease me about how I do things.” Based on what you describe, I imagine most of your friends would be surprised and sorry to learn that this makes you feel on edge and as if you are being forced to justify your every action. If one of them occasionally slips up and truly doesn’t seem aware that what they’ve just said feels harsh, you can briskly but kindly say, “This falls under the category of things I’d rather you didn’t ask me about. Let’s talk about something else.” Advertisement * * * Dear Prudence: The “Anti-Pronoun” Edition requirejs([ 'premium-panoply', 'css!../css/components/premium-panoply' ], function (premiumPanoply) ); Hear more Prudence at Slate.com/PrudiePod. Dear Prudence, I’m from the East Coast and am trying to decide where I want to live this coming year. Last month, I visited one of my best friends on the West Coast (we’d discussed the possibility of my moving there). I also hit it off with one of my friend’s good friends, and she and I have stayed in pretty regular contact since then. We’ve talked about trying to be together if she and I are ever in the same place at the same time again. Right now I have a lot of flexibility in terms of where I live. Is it a bad idea to move to the West Coast? I don’t feel like I’d be only moving there for this girl, but I also wouldn’t mind if something happened between us once I got there. —Making the Move I can’t promise you that moving west on a romantic hunch will be the greatest decision you will ever make, but this also doesn’t even come close to the worst idea to have crossed this column. (This West Coast city wouldn’t be any chance happen to be West Covina, would it?) You’d already been thinking about moving to your friend’s city before meeting this woman, and you’re not planning on getting into a committed relationship right away or moving in with her. If there are other cities you’ve been considering, go ahead and visit them too, and try to give your other options as fair a shake as possible before making the final call. But if this potential relationship tips your friend’s city into front-runner territory, then by all means, go and see what happens; even if things don’t work out between the two of you, you still like the area and know other people there—she’s not your only hope for a social life. * * * Dear Prudence, I am the oldest of four children ranging in age from 31 to 22. My dad died four years ago and my mother has only recently started dating. I know I should be happy for her but I am having a hard time with it. I avoided meeting her boyfriend for the longest time but I finally had dinner with them several weeks ago. He’s nice enough but it doesn’t make this any easier for me. I don’t really understand why I’m so angry about it, but I am. I try to put on a brave face when he’s around or when Mom talks about him, but I’m afraid my resentment is going to leak out. My siblings seem to tentatively approve of him, and I haven’t asked them what they truly think because I feel obligated to set a good example. I’m doing my best to appear supportive but it’s wearing on me. My mom is a wonderful woman and has every right to move on but when I see her with this guy, internally I’m screaming NO, WRONG, NO! Any idea how I can get past this? —Shouldn’t Feel This Way This is such a beautifully clear-cut case of Go to Therapy Tomorrow (GT3, trademark pending). It’s one thing to share privately with your siblings a sentiment like “I’m happy for Mom, and it’s also hard and strange in some ways to see her with someone who isn’t Dad”; it’s more of a concern if what you want to ask is, “Do you feel a pervasive sense of total panic at the sight of Mom’s new boyfriend?” That’s not to say you’re a bad child for reacting internally in a visceral way, but given that you don’t understand why you have these feelings, you should process them with someone outside the family. If your goal is to make sure those barely suppressed feelings of resentment and aversion don’t leak out in your interactions with your family, then your best bet is to share them in all their messy glory with a professional. In the meantime, if you have to keep your interactions with your mother’s new boyfriend on the brief side in order to stay composed, that’s fine too. You don’t have to become his best friend. Just stay polite and friendly and make sure you’ve got something scheduled immediately afterward that lets you release some of that pent-up aggression. You’ve only met him once; there’s an excellent chance that with time, therapy, and repeated exposure-therapy family dinners you’ll be able to get to know this guy on his own merits and not feel like screaming “YOU’RE NOT MY DAD” every time you see him. * * * Dear Prudence, My fiancé and I are getting married this month. Everything is already booked, and we’re expecting lots of family and friends to attend. My beloved grandmother is very ill in hospice care and will likely die quite soon—possibly on or just before our wedding day. I’d like to be able to continue with my wedding (and honor my grandmother during the ceremony) but I also wonder if it’s appropriate to have a ceremony at all while she’s on her deathbed or has recently died. Should we postpone the wedding? What if she dies on the day? I’m already devastated that she’s sick, but I don’t know anything about the etiquette about death and weddings besides the Hugh Grant movie. I want to respect my grandmother and, if possible, not lose the thousands of dollars we’d forfeit by canceling the wedding, as heartless as that sounds. —One Wedding and a Funeral A Slate Plus Special Feature: Help! How Do I Break Up With My Best Friend? Dear Prudence answers more of your questions—only for Slate Plus members. There are a number of questions for you and your fiancé to sort through before you make a decision. I would suggest sitting down together and figuring out both what those are and how to answer them. Here are just a few: How much time will your parents be able to spend away from your grandmother’s side during her final days? Would you feel a sense of relief if you postponed the ceremony? Do you have an idea of what your grandmother wants (if she is aware enough to understand)? Would it be possible to recover any of your deposits this close to the day, and would you be able to absorb the financial blow if you couldn’t? How many people are coming in from out of town who may already have purchased tickets and taken time off work? You are not, I think, obligated to postpone your wedding because of your grandmother’s illness, and it would not be necessarily inappropriate to go forward even if she had very recently died. Death is always sad, but this is not a surprising or untimely death. Consider what plans you’d like to make beforehand for a number of possible eventualities, weigh your options, and make whatever decision you feel the most comfortable with. But if what you’re looking for is permission to go ahead and continue with the wedding, you have it. It’s neither cold nor calculating to want to hold to your wedding date as planned as well as mourn your grandmother’s imminent passing. “In the midst of life we are in death”; spend as much time with her as you can in her final days, and celebrate the excitement of your upcoming wedding.

In 2014 and 2015, mutual funds, hedge funds and others pumped billions into companies that they now see as overvalued, and unlikely to pull off an initial public offering. As venture capitalists became more discerning, investment in U.S. tech startups plummeted by 30% in 2016 from a year earlier.For some, demand is still robust. Much of the money still being invested is pouring into the upper echelon of highly valued startups like Airbnb Inc. and WeWork Cos., or younger ones with clear paths to profit.“There are companies that everybody wants to invest in and there are a large set of companies that almost nobody wants to invest in,” said venture capitalist Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures.Venture-capital firms remain flush with cash: They raised $44 billion last year, the most since the dot-com boom.But investors are staying away from scores of well-funded startups that once looked like relatively safe bets, forcing these companies to fight for survival as they burn through their stockpiles of cash and scramble for new money or buyers.“They’re like the walking dead,” said David Cowan, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, who expects a steady stream of failures.In 2014 and 2015, more than 5,000 U.S. tech startups collectively raised about $75 billion, according to Dow Jones VentureSource—the largest amount in a two-year period since the dot-com boom.Much of that money went to a small share of tech startups: 294 such companies raised at least $50 million apiece. Almost three-quarters of those companies—216—have neither raised money nor been acquired since the end of 2015. Such companies tend to raise funding every 12 to 18 months.Seemingly every week lately, a well-funded startup is slashing jobs or pulling the plug.In recent months, mobile-search startup Quixey Inc. shut down after raising over $100 million, health-benefits broker Zenefits—which has raised more than $500 million—laid off nearly half of its staff, and blogging platform Medium cut one-third of its employees after raising $132 million.Such closures and cutbacks were rare two years ago when venture capitalists encouraged startups to expand rapidly to edge out competitors. Then when capital became scarcer, investors urged companies to turn profitable, which isn’t an easy pivot.Take startup Luxe Valet Inc., whose app lets people summon parking valets in bright-blue track jackets. Founded in 2013, the San Francisco company by early last year had plowed into eight markets and raised more than $70 million.Two competitors shut down. But expensive contracts to park cars in garages in big cities like Boston soaked up Luxe’s cash, according to a person familiar with the finances. The startup has had to retreat to three markets. Luxe didn’t respond to requests for comment.“There’s going to be a shakeout” for companies that can’t show a profit, said James Beriker, the chief executive of meal-delivery service Munchery. Mr. Beriker joined the company in January after a rocky period that resulted in several top executives leaving—including the co-founders.Munchery, which has spent much of its $120 million in funding, is raising a $10 million lifeline from existing investors. The company is cutting costs and aims to be profitable by year-end, Mr. Beriker said.For Beepi, profitability proved too distant for investors to wait.Founded in 2013, Beepi caught on in San Francisco by giving people a fail-safe way to sell used cars online. Beepi guaranteed sellers a price, and if it couldn’t find a buyer in 30 days, it purchased the car. Beepi marked up the price and pocketed the difference.Venture capital poured in, and its valuation surged from $12 million in early 2014 to $525 million by mid-2015. Beepi moved out of its cramped office by a Carl’s Jr. and into a glassy building where the chief executive zipped around on his own Segway. Staffers enjoyed quinoa salad and turkey meatball lunches and dinners when they often stayed late, and unwound with Ping-Pong or Nerf guns.The company’s strategy was a common one: blanketing the U.S. to thwart competitors rather than focusing on profit in a few cities.Beepi spent a fortune to entice buyers and sellers through radio and Facebook ads, spending an average of $1,730 on advertising per vehicle in most of its markets in the third quarter of 2016, according to fundraising documents issued last fall.Beepi was whipsawed by cars that sat unsold for a month, and that Beepi therefore had to purchase. Losses on those cars could reach more than $5,000 per high-end car, former employees said.Revenue for the first half of last year was $50 million, up about 40% from the previous six months. But with little revenue from add-on services like auto repair, Beepi was losing up to $5 million a month last year, the documents show. Costs were falling, but profitability wasn’t forecast until 2018.By mid-2016 CEO Ale Resnik hunted for cash to stanch the losses, but investors were spooked, former employees said. Mr. Resnik was in advanced talks with a Chinese company to raise tens of millions of dollars, he told staffers, but the deal crumbled in November.Most of Beepi’s staff was laid off in December, and the startup announced it was headed to liquidation in February.In an email, Mr. Resnik said he takes responsibility for missing goals.Employees say they believed the business would have proved sustainable if they were given more time.“It was clear to us internally how to get there,” said Tyler Infelise, Beepi’s head of product.

      "text" : "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump has become a virtual homebody during his first few months in office, largely sitting out the honeymoon period that other presidents have used to hit the road and rally support for their priorities.Mr. Trump, who dislikes spending the night away from home and has been adapting to life at the White House, has rarely ventured far from the Executive Mansion or his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida during his first 85 days in office. He has not strayed west of the Mississippi River, appearing at public events in only seven states and eschewing trips overseas. He is planning to travel to Wisconsin on Tuesday, and his first international trip is scheduled for next month, when he is to visit Brussels and Italy for meetings with world leaders.By contrast, President Barack Obama had made public appearances in nine states and taken three overseas trips by this point in his presidency, and was beginning his fourth journey abroad. And President George W. Bush had stopped in 23 states by mid-April during his first year in office and also visited Canada.“We are not seeing this president following the norm of going out to the public and making his case in the same way as presidents have for as far back as you want to go,” said James A. McCann, a professor of political science at Purdue University who has studied presidential travel patterns. “Trump is going to his own drummer, as usual. It’s a risky strategy.”Most presidents, hoping to seize on the public optimism that normally accompanies the start of a new administration, head out into the country to promote their agendas and apply political pressure — overt or otherwise — on lawmakers to fall in line. But Mr. Trump has held just a small number of political rallies in Florida, Tennessee and Kentucky, all states he won comfortably; visited a pair of military bases in Virginia and Florida; and spoken to aerospace and automotive workers in South Carolina and Michigan.“When you’re president, you don’t travel to get frequent flier miles — you travel to make a point,” said Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary to Mr. Bush, who used one elaborate tour to stop in states of Democratic senators whose support he needed for his tax-cut plan.“It’s surprising,” he continued, referring to Mr. Trump, “that he hasn’t used that power of the presidency to announce big policy initiatives and really drive home his point.”The White House says Mr. Trump, who has faced vexing problems at home and abroad, has avoided travel in order to focus on an ambitious domestic agenda, including the signing of executive orders and legislation to roll back Obama-era regulations. And he has used his time at the White House and at Mar-a-Lago to host an array of foreign leaders in an effort to repair relationships around the world.“Every time you travel, you’re eating up a big chunk of the day, so you have to be really strategic about it,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. “When you’re really trying to get a lot done, you have to budget your time very carefully, and we’re going to continue to be smart about the best use of his time, because his time is his most valuable asset.”“The pace of his schedule has been nonstop,” Mr. Spicer added.While the president has stayed close to home, he has dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to go farther afield. With Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago for Easter weekend, Mr. Pence arrived in Seoul, South Korea, on Sunday to start a 10-day trip through Asia, during which North Korea’s provocations were to be a major topic of discussion.Members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet have also traveled extensively, with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last week and the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, traveling to South Korea and Japan in February.White House officials had said Mr. Trump planned to travel extensively after his address to a joint session of Congress in February, as many presidents do to promote the domestic proposals featured in their State of the Union addresses. But a road show never materialized.Mr. Fleisher said that was not entirely a surprise. “It makes some sense that Donald Trump, whose candidacy was so much more about him — how he was different, how he could change Washington — rather than specific policy proposals, that his travel would be more about him personally than any initiative,” he said.The travel that Mr. Trump has done has often been more about his own political future than about policy persuasion.“What’s striking with President Trump is not only how contained his travel has been, but how much of it is around campaign rallies, rather than something he wants to get done,” said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a Brookings Institution scholar who has studied presidential travel.If Mr. Trump were following past practice, Dr. Tenpas added, he would have traveled the country to push the Republican plan to overhaul health care, his first foray into legislative deal making. That effort collapsed last month after both conservative and moderate Republicans joined Democrats in opposing it.But Mr. Spicer argued that a presidential road show on health care would not have changed the outcome, because Democrats had dug in against the plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act from the start.“That was pretty much a baked deal from the get-go,” he said.For now, the most frequent destination for Mr. Trump outside Washington has been Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla. He returned on Thursday, making a trip for Easter weekend — his seventh since taking office — that included near-daily stops at his golf resort in West Palm Beach. Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has spent 24 days at the exclusive club, sometimes called the Winter White House.The president has used Mar-a-Lago as a staging ground for meetings with foreign leaders, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Xi Jinping of China.Democrats and government watchdog groups have questioned the cost of the president’s Palm Beach excursions, and late last month, the Government Accountability Office began a review of the security procedures at Mar-a-Lago and the expense incurred by taxpayers for Mr. Trump’s trips there.The president’s limited travel stands in stark contrast with his approach during his campaign, when he kept up a rapid pace of events throughout the country. But it may be in line with his approach of making spontaneous decisions that have at times left White House aides struggling to respond.Presidential travel is complicated and time-consuming to plan, from scouting locations to determining a secure route for the motorcade. And Mr. Trump has vacillated about what his first policy priorities will be — shifting from health care to tax cuts and back to health care — which has most likely made it difficult to plot a travel schedule that would give him a strategic advantage.Mr. Spicer argued that was not a factor in Mr. Trump’s limited travel schedule.“It’s all about priorities,” he said.",

Denied the Bunny: This weekend we planned a campout for our 8-year-old son and a few of his friends. Parents were all happy to allow their children to attend even after we realized it was Easter weekend. However, one mother was insistent that I create a treat basket to give the kids from the Easter Bunny. My family does not celebrate this, and the other children camping with us all are aware of the nonexistence of the bunny. She wanted us to hold a special meeting, pre-campout, to explain to all the children that her son still believes and that we all need to keep up the facade. I politely rescinded my offer to take her child explaining that we have different goals for this campout and different beliefs. That while having her son with us, we would not be able to “keep the magic alive,” as she says, and it is unfair to ask a group of five 8-year-olds to lie to a friend. Now she is angry, telling people in our community that my family is against celebrating Christian holidays. Have I handled this incorrectly? What should I have done differently? Is there a need for me to apologize or do I try to ignore the accusation and hope cooler heads prevail? Subscribe to Prudie! A: Oh, Lord. No, you do not need to apologize to this boy’s parents for failing to prepare a treat basket for their son nor for enlisting a fleet of his peers to ensure he believes in the Easter Bunny for another year. (How odd, by the way, that this woman would conflate the Easter Bunny with a Christian holiday; bunnies are not a thematically significant element in the story of the Resurrection.) Holiday figures like Santa and the Easter Bunny are charming when it comes to entertaining small children, but it gets creepy when adults start concocting increasingly elaborate schemes to artificially extend their kid’s naïveté. Let her have her anger and stay distant but polite; the obvious irrationality of her complaint against you will not persuade any reasonable people that you are a bad parent or a poor sport. Q. Fun granny: This past weekend we spent some time with my family for the holiday. My mom in particular was in a great mood, something that I have not experienced for a few years. She has a condition which causes her chronic pain and has swung between depression and anger over the past year or so. It’s gotten to the point where I rarely answer her phone calls because I’m not sure whether or not I will be berated on the phone for things I have no involvement in, so seeing her in such a good mood this weekend was a nice surprise—and I was wondering what made the change happen. Well, it turns out she has a new prescription for medical marijuana that seems to be working. I think that’s great, the improvement in her mood is wonderful and our two toddlers had a fantastic time playing with grandma this weekend. When I returned home and told my friends about the change and the prescription they told me I shouldn’t leave my kids alone with her because she’s “high.” I feel like that mindset is a bit outdated, obviously I wouldn’t leave toddlers, or any child, with a “stoner,” but I feel like this is different. Who is right? I don’t want to endanger my kids or hurt granny’s feelings. Advertisement A: First off, it’s fantastic that your mother has found such profound relief from medical marijuana. It sounds like her course of treatment is successfully pain-relieving and has not, thus far, resulted in profound or noticeable impairment. Which is fantastic, and I think your distinction between your mother’s genuine improvement as a result of this treatment and just “getting high” is a legitimate one. She’s not attempting to check out mentally or emotionally, she’s attempting to manage her chronic pain. That said, it’s your responsibility as your kids’ parent to do some research, just as you would if your mother were taking any other medication with possibly mood-altering side effects. At least at first, I think it’s reasonable for you to make sure you or your partner are always with your mother when she’s spending time with your kids, so you can observe for yourself how they interact. You might ask her what her dosage is and how she’s feeling on it—not as part of an interrogation to prove she’s an unfit grandmother, but simply to learn more about how she’s doing and how you feel about it. If you feel comfortable leaving the kids with her for a few hours but not letting her take them on an overnight road trip, plan your visits to Grandma accordingly. Q. Best friend/girlfriend dilemma: My best friend is a guy. We’ve been best friends for years and I adore him. (There are no I’m-secretly-in-love-with-you feelings here.) He’s always had relationship troubles—can’t keep a girlfriend for more than six months, etc. Over the last year, I’ve begun to fear that one of his reasons for losing girlfriends is because of our relationship. We text 100 times a day, all of our stories are about each other, we can’t make a decision without talking to each other. Well, yeah. We’re best friends. But to be honest, if my boyfriend had a female best friend like me, I’d probably have a problem with it. I don’t want to stop being his BFF but I also want him to find a healthy relationship. Should I back off? But I don’t want to! A: I hope there’s at least a degree of playful hyperbole in your description of this relationship, because if you truly can’t make a decision without getting your best friend’s input, you need to start drawing some boundaries with him immediately. Not because you’re worried about some hypothetical future girlfriend of his, but for your own well-being. The fact that you feel partly responsible for your friend’s supposed inability to maintain a romantic relationship may speak to an unnecessary over-involvement on your part. You seem to think this is only a problem if it keeps your friend from getting a girlfriend, but put him aside for a second. How are you doing? There’s nothing wrong with having a deep and intimate friendship with another person, but I wonder if you have room for other relationships in your life (not just romantic ones!) if “all your stories” are about a single person. Let your friend worry about the women he dates, especially since this sounds fairly hypothetical so far. It’s not as if he’s told you he’s been dumped repeatedly as a direct result of his friendship with you. You don’t need to use his romantic life as an excuse for dialing back from a 100 to a 94 on the Emotional Intimacy Index. Advertisement You say you don’t want to back off, but you also sound genuinely concerned about the degree to which you two rely on one another, and I wonder if part of what worries you is the fear that you only have two options when it comes to connecting with your friend: brutally exposed, eyeball-to-eyeball closeness and constant, ceaseless communication or a painful, forced, artificial separation. I think you have more choices than that! What if you two texted, say, only 50 times a day? If merely “lots” of your stories were about one another? If occasionally you made a decision—even just a small one, like where to get lunch tomorrow—without talking to him about it at all? If you two left room in one another’s lives that allowed potential outside relationships room to flourish? I can’t guarantee this course of action would result in the immediate appearance of the perfect girlfriend for your BFF, but I think you might find you both cherish one another all the more for a little breathing room. Q. Can’t avoid my ex: I’m in college at a really small school, and have had the same group of friends for the entirety of the three years I’ve been here. I dated one of this group of friends for about a year and broke up with him a few months ago. He wasn’t a terrible boyfriend, but we were incompatible, and attempts to be friends haven’t been working. I’m now dating someone I’m a lot happier with, but the problem is I constantly see my ex. He’s still friends with the rest of my close friends, so I can’t go to smaller gatherings without it being awkward. He’s also almost always in my apartment as he’s close with my roommate and she invites him over, and it’s gotten to the point where I feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in my own home, especially when it comes to inviting my current SO over. My ex has never acknowledged the problem with this, despite attempts to speak to him about it. He usually avoids talking to me now, so I’m not sure what the best solution to this ongoing awkwardness is. A: If your ex-boyfriend is as much a part of your circle of friends as you are, it’s likely you’ll have to resign yourself to continuing to see him at least some of the time. Your apartment, however, is another matter. Have you ever asked your roommate to dial back how frequently she has him over as a guest? Do you two have any mutually-agreed-upon rules about guests in general? It’s always frustrating to have a third “unofficial roommate” hanging around, much less when that third roommate is someone you used to date. Ask to establish some basic ground rules about having guests over together. Depending on how that goes, you may decide you want to spend some more time out of your apartment and away from this particular circle of friends. That doesn’t mean you have to move across town and ditch your entire social circle; just make sure you set aside time every day doing something you know won’t involve seeing your ex. That may involve looking for a different roommate next year. Q. Re: Fun granny: Medical marijuana strains can be selected so that they include the chemical that relieves pain but not the chemical that makes one feel high. Some strains are specifically identified for people who need pain relief but must go to work and be fully engaged and clear-minded. The whole field is much more sophisticated than it was formerly. Advertisement A: Absolutely! We don’t know what strain the grandmother in question is using, or how she’s ingesting it, but there are lots of medical marijuana users out there whose treatment plans involve symptomatic relief and not getting high. Q. Bad advice from my therapist: My therapist wants me to do something and I think it’s a bad idea, so I’m looking for some neutral advice. When I was a child, I was sexually abused by my older brother. For a very long time, I didn’t think this had much of an impact on me. It only happened a few times. When I told my parents, they talked to my brother and it didn’t happen again. We never spoke of it again. Here I am, 25 years old, two eating disorders and a suicide attempt later, and I realize how very stupid that was. I’ve never been in a relationship. The idea of sex terrifies me. I haven’t even been kissed since middle school. My therapist thinks I should talk with my family and get everything out in the open, so they better understand what I’ve been through. I don’t think there’s anything to be gained from this. I can’t change what happened, and as far as I know, my brother has never repeated his behavior. My family isn’t good at honest conversations—but I don’t need them to be. I would rather deal with this on my own. What do you think? Should I try my therapist’s idea? A: If you don’t feel ready to speak to your family about your abuse, or simply don’t wish to, then that is reason enough not to do it. Every patient has the right to say “No” to their therapist, and a good therapist will respect the boundary and move on. Q. Women on a guys’ weekend: My husband and I socialize with another couple that we met at a meetup about a year and a half ago. Six months ago, the husband invited mine on a guys’ hiking weekend. In the six months leading up to it, it was discussed often and always as a guys-only weekend. On the car ride there, my husband found out that some men were bringing their wives. I am furious at the couple for lying to me. I wouldn’t have wanted to go, and I wouldn’t have been upset that my husband was going, but I do think it’s a huge lie considering we talked about it no less than 10 times in the months leading up. I expressed my anger after the weekend and got a halfhearted apology from the husband and basically that they see it as a guys’ weekend because their group doesn’t bring their wives. I maintain that since women go every single year, it had to be a deliberate choice to keep me in the dark until my husband was on the way there. The wife began texting me this weekend (the trip was in the beginning of March) because they want to move forward and go back to hanging out. I feel that they either deliberately lied to me or if not, they have horrible judgment in never once mentioning that other guys might bring their wives. I know my husband would like me to get over it too but I just can’t, especially since their apology was, “I’m sorry but we didn’t do anything on purpose so you shouldn’t be mad anymore.” Top Comment Dear Prudie: My husband sometimes meets the guys at a local bar for a few drinks and to watch the game. They say it is a guy's only thing. But I have driven by the bar. They allow women, too. More... Join In Advertisement A: You should let this go. Your friend and his group clearly treat this weekend as a guys’ getaway, and if the camping trip is anything like the meetup you all met at, they can’t control whether or not unrelated strangers bring their partners. Regardless, this does not fall under the category of “a huge lie,” and your outraged response is unwarranted and unpleasant. You have not been betrayed or “kept in the dark” about anything significant, you are not the Count of Monte Cristo, and you should accept this couple’s overtures and move on. If you don’t—and if you insist on holding this up as an example of “horrible judgment”—you may find yourself left off even more invitations in the future. Q. Bridesmaid vs. bridezilla: When a bride insists that her bridal party get their hair and makeup done professionally by a person of her choosing who charges Hollywood prices, who should pay? The girls in the party want to either do their own, which some are more than capable of, or find someone in their budget range. The bride is unmovable. Her mother even called me to ask if I’d foot the bill for my daughter as “photos matter” to the bride. I’m currently unemployed, so this is a big ask. What is the etiquette? A: The etiquette is, “No, I will not pay for that.” Discuss this column with Dear Prudence on her Facebook page! Click here to read Part 2 of this week’s chat.",

      "text" : "Stephen K. Bannon, chief strategist to President Trump, at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., in late 2016. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Stephen K. Bannon was running an investment banking company in Beverly Hills when his partner called with urgent news: a potential $10 billion deal was about to unfold in New York City involving a company they hoped to continue representing — and they didn’t want to be left out of the action. Bannon, then in his mid-40s, told his business partner to meet him at the Los Angeles airport in an hour. Soon, they appeared at the Manhattan offices of PolyGram, a worldwide music company that they had previously represented in a film deal and now was for sale. Before long, Bannon came up with an angle. He had represented Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, in a prior deal, and now he proffered the royal-family member, one of the world’s wealthiest Arabs, as a bidder. PolyGram was impressed and eventually paid Bannon a sizable fee for work on the overall deal. “Those out of the room are out of the deal,” Bannon, now 63, said in an interview, recalling the 1998 meeting. “Once you make your way into the room, you stay.” Years before Bannon became the architect of an anti-globalist revolution — working as chief strategist under President Trump to weaken free-trade deals, restrict immigration from a number of majority-Muslim nations and slam corporations that move jobs overseas — he made his fortune as the quintessential global capitalist. An examination of Bannon’s career as an investment banker found that the Bannon of the 1980s and 1990s lived what looks like an alternate reality from the fiery populist of today who recently declared that “globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia.” With stints at Goldman Sachs and his own firm, Bannon was a creature of corporatism, wealth-building and international finance.

Meet Stephen Bannon, Trump's chief White House strategist Embed Copy Share Play Video2:08 (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Here's what you need to know about the man who went from Breitbart News chairman to Donald Trump's campaign CEO before his appointment as chief White House strategist and senior counselor. Here's what you need to know about the man who went from being Breitbart News's chairman to Trump's campaign CEO and now to chief White House strategist. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Bannon, in two interviews for this report, acknowledged that he relied heavily on foreign financing in eight years of running a firm eventually known as Bannon & Co. But he said the world in which he once operated, and made millions, had been changed by banks that now look out for themselves rather than their clients — and by multinational corporations that undermined the working class. “We always were the financier of entrepreneurs, of which I’m a huge believer, and I’m not a believer in the corporatist mentality,” he said. By his telling, this is the sentiment that led to the Bannon of today, the one who helped transform the far-right Breitbart News site into a platform for nationalism and then joined forces with Trump to upend much of Republican ideology. Today, Bannon functions as a counterweight in the White House to an array of fellow Trump advisers who inhabit his former world, top officials from Goldman Sachs as well as other Wall Street veterans who embrace a more traditional brand of GOP policies such as free trade. Yet in many respects, it is Bannon’s experience in their world that has positioned him for the struggle. “I have lived all over the world, worked all over the world, financed with great partners all over the world,” Bannon said. “I’m not some angry guy sitting there. I think I have a pretty good feel for the direction of Europe, Asia and the United States, almost 40 years of experience.” 1 of 13 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × EmbedCopyShare 13 things you may not have known about Stephen K.

He attended Harvard Business School, where he met recruiters from the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs. He landed a summer job at the company’s New York City office and then a full-time position upon graduation. He arrived in 1985 to work on mergers and acquisitions. Bannon “was unusual insofar as he was a bit older and he came from a military background, and that fact was core to his persona. . . . [He was] independent minded, with strong points of view,” said John L. Thornton, a former president of Goldman Sachs who steered the bank in an international direction, and whom Bannon considered as his mentor. Bannon served in the U.S. Navy, in two deployments between 1978 and 1980. (Courtesy of the Bannon family) Bannon’s main task during his first three years at Goldman Sachs was to respond to a boom in hostile takeovers. Goldman Sachs took the side of companies under attack from corporate raiders and leveraged buyout firms. Bannon had to come up with strategies to protect companies from unwanted suitors. “A takeover is a very intense time. It is like you are going to battle,” said Scot Vorse, who attended Harvard with Bannon and worked with him at Goldman Sachs and Bannon & Co. “It was crazy. I worked many, many weeks in excess of 100 hours, and I know Steve did that often. At 10 p.m., you have 150 people walking around a floor with a piece of pizza and cup of coffee.” After three years and a promotion to vice president — a title that was given to many Goldman Sachs employees — Bannon moved to the company’s Los Angeles office and was given the mission of drumming up business. He cold-called companies, looking to represent them as they considered splitting up or acquiring new businesses. A turning point came in 1989, when Bannon said he persuaded Goldman Sachs to invest heavily in a fledgling company called Qualcomm, which was working on cellular telephone technology. Bannon said he did not receive extra compensation from the deal, which he said made a huge profit for Goldman Sachs. While he said he made about $450,000 annually at the time, that was a “night and day” difference, compared with what he might have made at a firm that paid him a huge fee for the deal. The philosophy of Goldman Sachs was to pay generously but not to provide the highest compensation until executives were made into partners, which could take years. “It was a huge effort to get it done,” Bannon said. “I thought about it: ‘I will get all the grief if this deal doesn’t work out and none of the upside if it does well.’ . . . That investment was worth hundreds of millions of dollars.” So in 1990, Bannon started his own firm. He said the move was not about money. “It has always been about doing something I want to do and proving to myself I could do it,” he said. “Starting Bannon & Co. was a huge risk. People thought I was insane.” Bannon stayed in California, he said, because he was focused on valuing intellectual property such as the movie industry — as opposed to the hard assets in the oil and gas business — and he believed there were big profits to be made as “the media and entertainment industry was just about to globalize.” Bannon wanted to do big deals, but he didn’t have the financing. So he began to explore options overseas, including Japan, where investors were eager to get involved in Hollywood projects. He struck a five-year deal with a major Japanese bank, Nissho Iwai, which he said supplied millions of dollars. Relying on foreign money became a model for Bannon’s work. “Our forte was working with American companies to work with foreign investors,” Bannon said. Bannon set up shop in Beverly Hills with Vorse, his former classmate and Goldman Sachs colleague. But much of his time was spent abroad in places such as Hong Kong and Singapore. One of the company’s early successes involved a sale of television properties that wound up giving Bannon and his partners a huge payoff from future airings of what was then a little-known situation comedy: “Seinfeld.” By 1996, with the Japanese deal having run its course, Bannon & Co. entered a partnership with Société Générale, a giant French investment company. The joint venture, which allowed Bannon to retain control over his company, was called Société Générale Bannon. At the same time, Bannon’s global aspirations were solidified through a deal in which he got to know Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who today is the world’s 45th wealthiest person, with a net worth of $18 billion, according to Forbes magazine. The prince declined to comment. The prince, a nephew of the Saudi king, headed the United Saudi Commercial Bank and had major investments in companies including Euro Disney, Citibank and Saks Fifth Avenue. He made much of his fortune trading tens of millions of dollars on U.S. stock markets. He also made two purchases of properties that he has said “bailed out” Trump: the 1991 purchase of Trump’s yacht; and a $325 million purchase — in 1995, with a Singapore investor — of the Plaza Hotel.

(Barry Iverson/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images) *** Bannon said that starting in 1992, he met with the prince at least a dozen times, including in Beverly Hills and New York City, and possibly at the Cannes Film Festival. The prince co-owned a firm with pop star Michael Jackson called Kingdom Entertainment. In 1996, Bannon advised the prince on Kingdom’s purchase of a 50 percent stake in Landmark Entertainment, a Hollywood-based company that produced music and television programs and developed theme parks. Bannon remained in touch with the prince, meeting him at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, in which the prince owned a stake, Vorse said. In addition, Vorse traveled to Riyadh to meet with the Saudi prince. “Alwaleed was very savvy,” Bannon said. “He was a client for five or six years. . . . He had great ambitions. He wanted to be the Walt Disney of the Middle East.” In 1998, the prince became an important part of one of Bannon’s biggest deals, when Vorse heard a rumor that a suitor wanted to buy PolyGram in what was expected to be a $10 billion deal. “We show up in New York,” Vorse said. “We march into their executive suites. We say, ‘We are here to help; can we hang out in your conference room til you need us?’ It was almost like we were white-collar squatters. We moved into the conference room.” A couple of possible bidders, including the Canadian conglomerate Seagram’s, were lined up when Bannon proposed the prince as an alternative. When a PolyGram executive questioned Bannon’s relationship with the prince, Bannon responded that he should “call the prince’s main guy” to check it out, Vorse said. A short while later, the PolyGram president signaled to Bannon and Vorse with “the big thumbs-up,” Vorse said. In the end, the prince didn’t buy PolyGram, but his work led him to be retained by the company, and Bannon said the prospect of an alternative bidder helped boost the price by 20 percent. Bannon said he received “a big fee,” though he declined to disclose the amount. As a result of this and other deals, Bannon’s company was ranked as the world’s fourth most valuable media investment bank, ahead of firms with thousands more employees, according to Vorse. Soon, Bannon agreed to sell his company for an undisclosed amount to a subsidiary of his French partner, Société Générale, a move that eventually put an end to his role at the company he created. While it is not possible to independently verify Bannon’s profits during this time, he said the deals and the sale of the company made him very wealthy. He said he had far exceeded whatever he was likely to have earned by staying with Goldman Sachs. During his 14 years in investment banking, Bannon was invariably described by friends as a country-club type of Republican, trim, athletic and movie-star handsome. A number of former colleagues said that they don’t recognize the Bannon of today, either in his rhetoric or disheveled appearance. Bannon has said he was fundamentally changed by the impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis prompted Bannon to say that Wall Street no longer operated in the way he was taught, by working to build companies and watch out for a client’s interest. The financial crisis, he said, was caused by those whose main motivation was to make as much money as possible for oneself, a “financialization” of Wall Street that put bankers’ profits over those of everyday investors. “It was before all these quants and mathematicians really came to Wall Street,” Bannon said in a French documentary about Goldman Sachs. He said he was further infuriated by the taxpayer bailouts of major banks, which were engineered by the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was President George W. Bush’s treasury secretary. Bannon has also said that he took a hard turn to the right because his father, who worked for AT&T, lost money selling the company’s stock in the wake of the financial crisis. Bannon began using some of his fortune to produce movies that reflected a darker worldview. His films, such as “Generation Zero,” portrayed the United States as sliding into a cultural and financial decline. Bannon channeled his anger into support for the tea party movement and, later, into pressing an anti-globalist message as chairman of Breitbart News. Bannon has said Breitbart News is “the platform for the alt-right,” referring to a small movement that seeks a whites-only state. Bannon, however, has said he is not a white nationalist but a “strong American nationalist.” Bannon’s views eventually were embraced by Trump, who was an avid reader of Breitbart News and had been interviewed by Bannon on a radio program. Trump hired Bannon in August 2016 as his campaign’s chief executive, and the former investment banker helped steer the self-described multibillionaire to the presidency with a populist message. While Bannon shaped Trump’s agenda, his former client, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, was aghast at Trump’s proposal to have a “total and complete and shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The prince said on Twitter — in which he owned a $1 billion stake — that Trump’s proposal was a “disgrace.” Trump tweeted back that he was a “dopey prince.” politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Today's WorldView What's most important from where the world meets Washington Please provide a valid email address.

That was just the beginning of an effort by the Saudis to court the new president, and they were rewarded with a March 14 meeting in the Oval Office with Trump and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a son of Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz. Bannon, whose principle for decades has been to be in the room when a deal is being made, was by Trump’s side during the meeting.

      "text" : "Just as Uber is under fire once again, Lyft confirms a huge new funding round, Elon Musk reveals plans for electric trucks and Apple is diving into secret special projects. These are the top tech stories of the week. You can also get this post as the Weekly Roundup newsletter delivered to your inbox on Saturdays, if that’s more your style. 1. Uber’s “Hell-ish” week\nA report surfaced claiming that Uber secretly tracked Lyft drivers using an internal software program called “Hell.” Hell not only let Uber see how many Lyft drivers were available for rides and what their prices were, but also figure out which of its drivers were also driving for Lyft. Once Uber knew when and where they tended to log onto Lyft, the company was able to offer drivers financial incentives convincing them to use only Uber. Some lawyers are saying Uber could face civil legal claims related to its use of the software. It was also announced this week that Rachel Whetstone, Uber’s head of communications and policy, is leaving the company. We know that her reason for leaving is complex, but there was some tension between Whetstone and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick over bad press. 2. Apple may have hired biomedical researchers to work on a secret project Apple seems to be on a special projects hiring spree. A new report is claiming that Apple has hired a group of biomedical researchers to work on a secret project to monitor diabetic patients using sensors. Normally, patients monitor their glucose by pricking themselves to get a blood sample, so not having to do that any more would be a real game-changer for people affected by diabetes. It was reported that Apple is also putting together a team to design its own battery management chip for the iPhone. By designing its own chips, Apple could go a bit further than the standard power management chip, making the iPhone slightly more efficient in power usage. This way, the company could get a leg up on Android makers when it comes to battery life.\nIn other Apple news, the California DMV released a list of companies allowed to test autonomous vehicles on the roads of California. The last name of the long list is Apple. It doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re going to see an Apple car on the road tomorrow… but it means that the company has the green light to start real-world tests at some point in the future.\n3. Tesla’s plan for trucks Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed on Twitter that Tesla plans to show off an electric pickup truck sometime within the next two years. Musk also announced that Tesla will reveal its electric semi truck, the Tesla Semi, in September of this year.\n4. Lyft confirms major $600 million raise, bringing total funding to $2.61 billion\nLyft confirmed on its blog that it has raised a total of $600 million in new funding, with a post-money valuation of $7.5 billion. The funding brings Lyft’s total funding to $2.61 billion, which is a gigantic amount unless you consider the incredibly competitive space within which they operate, which includes Uber, with $8.8 billion invested across 13 rounds.\n5. Instagram Stories is now bigger than Snapchat\nInstagram Stories hit 200 million daily active users, surpassing Snapchat Stories’ 161 million users it reported in March when the parent company, Snap, went public. Instagram is also getting faster at copying Snapchat features; it also added Instagram Direct and an AR Stories feature this week.\n6. Yext sees successful IPO on the NYSE\nThis week saw another tech IPO as Yext, the company that helps businesses power their location data, went public on the New York Stock Exchange. After pricing shares above the expected range at $11, the price rose 21 percent to $13.29 by the end of the first day of trading. 7. Nintendo’s NES Classic shipments come to a close\nAll good things must come to an end. This week Nintendo said that it will be sunsetting the short-lived but beloved NES Classic Edition — the $60 console that gave us 30 classic Nintendo games. However, the language was not so clear, indicating room for a potential release in the future: “Throughout April, [Nintendo of America] territories will receive the last shipments of Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition systems for this year.” So if you don’t have one yet, there’s still hope. But get ready to pay big bucks in the meantime.\n8. Flipkart has a fresh $1.4 billion raise\nAmazon and Alibaba had better watch out. Following months of rumors, Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart has confirmed that it has raised $1.4 billion in new funding at a post-money valuation of $11.6 billion. The deal includes some big-name strategic investors: China’s Tencent, eBay and Microsoft, which join existing Flipkart backers that include Tiger Global, Naspers, Accel and DST Global.\n9. Hulu’s live TV to cost $39.99 per month\nMore details emerged on Hulu’s play to kill the cable box. The pricing for Hulu’s live TV service, a competitor with cable television — as well as a host of other streaming TV services like Sling TV, DirecTV NOW and YouTube TV — will likely be $39.99 per month, with ads and access to Hulu’s on-demand library.\n10. Andre Iguodala spills Magic Leap secrets\nMagic Leap had some of its secrets spilled by Golden State Warriors small forward Andre Iguodala. In an interview, Iguodala talked about augmented reality and undoubtedly skated the lines of violating his Magic Leap NDA as he described his demo with the product, which he called a “disruption of life.” Iguodala gave some interesting insight into what a Magic Leap interface might look like, saying that in one demonstration he stuck his hand out and a character appeared in his hand that acted as a digital assistant for the device, something Iguodala compared to Apple’s Siri. He referenced the character’s ability to control smart-home devices, as well as other aspects of the operating system.\n11. Qualtrics is holding on IPO Utah-based SaaS company Qualtrics’ IPO many have been expecting is on hold for now. The online market research platform has just raised its third round for $180 million at a whopping $2.5 billion valuation.\nWeekend reads\nWhy do airlines overbook their flights?\nYou may have seen an airline offer someone $500 to voluntarily give up their seat on a flight because they are overbooked. If you are going to a funeral, to an important meeting or if you’re a doctor on your way to see a patient, that may not work. If you’re on vacation, however, and you figure that $500 to spend on another flight later in the year means a free trip to visit the family, you may be willing to let yourself be bumped off the flight. But why do airlines overbook flights? Here’s a detailed explanation.

      "text" : "President Trump on Wednesday proposed a dramatic overhaul of the tax code, calling for sharply lower rates for individuals and businesses but also eliminating key tax breaks. The proposal is a one-page outline — key details are left incomplete — but it presents an initial offer to begin negotiations with lawmakers, as White House officials think reworking the tax code is one of their biggest priorities to boost economic growth. “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something big and important on taxes,” White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said Wednesday. [Trump’s tax proposal: What it means for the rich, for the world and for you] White House officials are ambitious, but the path to overhauling the tax code is riddled with political land mines. Many budget experts say they believe the White House’s plan would reduce federal revenue by so much that it would grow the debt by trillions of dollars in the next decade, growing interest costs and slowing the economy. Mnuchin announces proposal for corporate tax rate reduction Embed Copy Share Play Video1:17 (Reuters) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced a proposal for a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate at the White House on April 26. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced a proposal for a significant reduction in the corporate tax rate at the White House on April 26. (Reuters) And Trump’s advisers are looking to ax some tax breaks that are very popular in certain states, including the deduction Americans take for the state and local taxes they pay separately each year. Eliminating this deduction could save more than $1 trillion over 10 years but inflame lawmakers and governors in states that have high income tax rates. The central feature of the White House’s plan would be a big reduction in tax rates for virtually all Americans and businesses. It would eliminate the seven existing income tax brackets and replace them with three brackets, containing new rates of 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, based on someone’s income. White House officials haven’t specified which income levels would hit the higher tax brackets, as they see that as part of ongoing discussions with Capitol Hill. It would also roughly double the standard deduction that Americans can use to reduce their taxable income. The deduction for married couples would move from $12,600 to $24,000. This would incentivize people not to itemize their tax returns and instead use the standard deduction, simplifying the process and potentially saving taxpayers thousands of dollars each year. The White House plan would eliminate the alternative-minimum tax and the estate tax, provisions that raise billions of dollars each year but have long been the target of Republicans seeking to rip up the tax code. Cohn, speaking of the AMT, said “we don’t think that people should have to do their taxes twice,” and added that the estate tax unfairly prevented farmers and others from passing along their businesses to the next generation. To offset some of the cost of the lower rates, Trump administration officials said they were proposing to eliminate virtually all tax deductions that Americans claim, provisions that they argued primarily benefited wealthier Americans. Cohn said they would preserve tax breaks that incentivize homeownership, retirement savings and charitable giving. But almost all others would be jettisoned. This includes the tax deduction people can claim for the state and local taxes they pay each calendar year. These taxes can be particularly high in states with higher income taxes, such as California and New York. “It’s not the federal government’s job to be subsidizing the states,” Mnuchin told reporters at the briefing with Cohn. “It’s the state’s independent decision as to do what they want to tax.” Some of the White House’s tax changes would benefit the wealthy, such as the elimination of the estate tax, while other changes would benefit the middle class and lower-income Americans. For businesses, Trump’s proposal would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, and it would also allow smaller businesses, structured in such a way that they are affected by the individual tax rate, to also use the 15 percent threshold. There are millions of these businesses, known as “S corporations,” and they are often small, family-owned firms. [Trump tax cut to be biggest of all time, treasury secretary says] But they can also include large law firms and lobbying shops. Mnuchin said special protections would be put in place to ensure that the 15 percent rate isn’t taken advantage of by the wealthiest earners, though he didn’t say how the White House would do this. The White House is also proposing a one-time tax “holiday” to incentivize companies to bring several trillion dollars currently being held in other countries back into the United States. They didn’t specify what that tax rate would be, saying its part of negotiations on Capitol Hill, but they said they believed providing this incentive would bring money back for investment and hiring. “We expect that trillions of dollars will come back on shore and will be reinvested here in the United States, for capital goods and job creation,” Mnuchin said. This process is called “repatriation.” It’s controversial, because critics allege the money is brought back and then paid out in dividends to shareholders, not used for hiring. But Democrats and Republicans have both been open to the idea of a tax holiday. The Obama administration proposed using one to bring money back into the United States that could be used for new infrastructure projects, for example. A key part of Trump’s tax plan during the campaign was to levy a tax or tariff against companies that move overseas and then try to sell their products back to U.S. consumers. Cohn and Mnuchin said they were still looking at alternatives on how to structure this idea, and it was not an element of the plan rolled out Wednesday. They said they found a plan embraced by House Republican leaders to be unworkable in its current form, but they are going to work with key lawmakers to see if adjustments can be made, Mnuchin said. That GOP plan, led by Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), that would have offset broad reduction in rates with a change in the way imports and exports are taxed, a proposal known as a “border adjustment tax.” Mnuchin also said White House officials were hopeful that their plan could win support from Democrats, but he said they were willing to forge ahead without them if necessary. They could use a special budget process known as reconciliation to pass the changes through the Senate with a simple majority vote, though this would be very difficult given how sharp they are planning to cut taxes. Mnuchin also said their goal was to make permanent changes to the tax code, but they would consider a shorter-term change if necessary to win political support. “This is what’s important to get the American economy going,” Mnuchin said. “So I hope [Democrats] don’t stand in the way. And I hope we see many Democrats who cross the aisle and support this. Having said that, if they don’t, we are prepared to look at the reconciliation process.” Ahead of the announcement, some Democrats were skeptical. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), said members of his party would scrutinize the details, but he predicted the package could amount to major tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and for businesses like those formerly run by Trump. “That’s not tax reform,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “That’s just a tax giveaway to the very, very wealthy that will explode the deficit.” Speaking Wednesday morning on Capitol Hill, Ryan called Trump’s framework “a critical step forward in this effort.” “We’ve been briefed on what they are going to do, and it is basically along exactly the same lines we want to go,” Ryan said. “So we see this as progress being made, showing that we are moving and getting on the same page. We see this as a good thing.” business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Trump’s tax plan does have an advantage over Ryan’s and other plans, including those supported by some Democrats, that aim to be make up the forgone revenue. While there is broad bipartisan support for plans that cut rates but make up for it with the elimination of certain tax breaks or reductions in spending, coalitions have frequently fallen apart over where those savings should come from. Many public programs and exemptions and deductions in the tax system have broad popular support, or are defended by powerful interests. [Republicans’ plan to cut corporate taxes would lead to massive revenue losses, congressional accountant finds] The trouble Trump has is that while his administration says the tax cuts will over time pay for themselves, Congress’s nonpartisan budgetary referees at the Joint Committee on Taxation won’t work off that same assumption. Because of the rules of the Senate, legislation that would result in more borrowing over the long term would be vulnerable to a Democratic filibuster, requiring 60 senators to advance the legislation. Republicans hold just 52 seats in the chamber, and absent those 60 votes, Trump and his fellow Republicans would only be able to pass cuts that would last for 10 years. After that time, the tax cuts would expire unless Congress takes action, setting up another fight over taxes.",

Drumpf is fuming at yet another federal judge. Earlier this week, San Francisco District Judge William H. Orrick temporarily enjoined the Drumpf administration’s simultaneously grandiose and ultimately toothless plan to strip federal funding from sanctuary cities. The president, as is his wont, apparently decided it’s pointless to threaten and undermine an individual jurist when he could go after an entire federal appellate court. So off he went on a boilerplate Twitter rant in which he wrongly blamed the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for his loss at the trial court level; wrongly characterized that appellate court’s reversal record; and wrongly faulted a city and county in California for “judge shopping” (not an actual legal term) for opting to file in the jurisdiction in which they exist, as opposed to filing in, say, Texas or Georgia, where they do not exist. (Circuits are geographic, not ideological.) No matter what you do to the 9th Circuit, California will still be California. And Drumpf’s fury at the 9th Circuit ignores the fact that he has also been thwarted by federal judges on courts in various other jurisdictions, including the 2nd and 4th Circuits, where thinking jurists also roam free. Dahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate, and hosts the podcast Amicus. Never one to let actual facts or geographic reality stand between himself and his grudges, Drumpf escalated his war on the federal judicial branch Wednesday with an interview with the Washington Examiner in which he pledged to revisit plans to break up the 9th Circuit, presumably because he thinks breaking up a federal circuit court will magically change his badly drafted executive orders into legally sound ones: “Everybody immediately runs to the 9th Circuit. And we have a big country. We have lots of other locations. But they immediately run to the 9th Circuit. Because they know that’s like, semi-automatic,” Drumpf said. I am frankly shivering in delicious anticipation of Drumpf’s forthcoming executive order breaking up the 9th Circuit. Advertisement The president doesn’t seem to realize that his newest attack on the courts, by its own terms, simply strengthens Orrick’s case—that the order, read as Drumpf’s lawyers now suggest, reinforces the status quo, or, read as Drumpf characterizes it, is unconstitutional. Every time he talks, he makes things worse. Even his own administration formally stopped using the phrase Muslim ban when it tried to salvage his first executive order, so Drumpf’s decision to call it a “ban” again in his Wednesday tweetstorm and interviews just doesn’t much help him. Consider also that Drumpf’s defense of his vague and sloppily drafted executive orders consists, at bottom, of celebrating the fact that they are vague and sloppy. As he told the Examiner of his travel ban: “The language could not be any clearer. I mean, the language on the ban, it reads so easy that a reasonably good student in the first grade will fully understand it. And they don't even mention the words in their rejection on the ban.” Time and again, the president fails to comprehend that the reason a reasonably smart first-grader can understand his executive orders is because they appear to have been written by a different reasonably smart first-grader in orange crayon on the back side of a Red Lobster children’s menu. Time and again he asserts that there is some virtue in stripping away all nuance and legal meaning from his official acts as president. Time and again he complains bitterly when federal judges, searching for nuance and meaning, look to his words as a means of filling out the vague nonsense of his lawyers’ unerringly incoherent work product. First-grade homework may be clear to Drumpf, but that does not make it useful when it comes to practical application for governing our nation. As Garrett Epps notes, Drumpf’s sanctuary cities order fails even the most basic principles of interpretive clarity: “[I]t announces measures against ‘sanctuary jurisdictions’ but provides no definition of that term.” The fact that Drumpf’s own lawyers defended the order in court by saying it was essentially meaningless posturing helps him not at all. If the total force of the order was to create a “bully pulpit” that will later allow the president to say things that alternately have legal force or do not, Orrick cannot have been mistaken in enjoining it. Like the travel ban before it, the thing was nothing more than a Snapchat order, an executive action that could fade into nothing—or could be surreptitiously screenshotted to be preserved as something, at the president’s whim and pleasure. Get Slate in your inbox. Drumpf’s repeated—one might almost call them semiautomatic—presidential speech acts that contradict his formal orders as written cannot be excused as just further bloviating from an overtalkative and underinformed president. Both his travel ban and his sanctuary cities order have suffered in court because, in the absence of clarity and detail, federal judges may look to the president’s campaign promises, television appearances, and tweets to understand his intent in promulgating them. There is a robust and heated academic debate about whether judges should be in the business of probing what’s in the president’s heart of hearts, but wholly apart from that lies another problem: Do the president’s actual words matter at all? This isn’t about judicial efforts at mind-reading, a practice against which Justice David Souter famously warned about in McCreary County v. ACLU: a “judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter’s heart of hearts.” What’s in the president’s heart of hearts is unknowable and not remotely interesting. Drumpf’s executive orders appear to have been written by a reasonably smart first-grader in orange crayon on the back side of a Red Lobster children’s menu. But what he actually says, when the words come out of his face? What he writes, be it in pen or Twitter? These are still presidential actions. The dangerous judicial psychologizing here would be for reviewing courts to attempt to differentiate between those instances when the president means what he says and when he’s just blathering recreationally. In Josh Blackman’s excellent meditation on this subject in Politico, he warns judges not to treat Drumpf differently than they would treat other presidents. I agree. And that means when Drumpf says things about his policy goals, presumably to bolster or refine or undermine his sloppy legal orders, they have some legal force. The alternative is a jurisprudential Escher staircase of meaningless words on paper, in an unending shifting dialogue of meaningless presidential words that shift from bird to fish and back again. Drumpf has always spoken publicly as if his words have not only no meaning but also no lasting consequences—walking back his preposterous claims as soon as they become untenable. But as president of the United States, his words have both meaning and consequences, whether he wants them to or not. And as Orrick pointed out: “While the President is entitled to highlight his policy priorities, an Executive Order carries the force of law.” Here is one thing I can say for certain about judges: In addition to having a generalized and free-floating anxiety about public attacks on their legitimacy and authority, they resent deeply any efforts to say that words—the sole implement of their craft—have no meaning or that those meanings are inchoate and shifting and may expand or contract with the president’s hastily tweeted words or fleeting feelings. So when President Drumpf and his administration attack the judicial branch with authoritarian threats to break up the federal appeals court that has nothing to do with the ruling he disputes or insults individual “unelected” federal judges based on race or geographic region, sane judges, regardless of their personal politics, will recoil. They will feel, as Neil Gorsuch once put it, demoralized and disheartened by the president’s contempt. And when Drumpf insists on taking legal positions that suggest his executive orders are inherently lawful merely because he is the president or because their written-by-a-7-year-old clarity makes them obvious, that is an insult to the judicial project, a threat to both separation of powers and judicial intelligence. Top Comment Drumpf's supporters run around proclaiming their love for the U.S. but seem to relish the thought of destroying the very institutions which make up the country's foundations. What do they want? A judiciary that takes orders from the president? More... Join In But when the president takes the posture, time and again, that his words and orders have meanings that are fluid and mutable and known only to himself, it is a surefire way for him to continue to lose in court. Drumpf and his advisers have long smugly intoned that the media, the public, and Congress must learn to take his words “seriously but not literally.” Sadly for him, the courts have no choice but take his words literally. There is, literally, no other option. The executive branch is more than a gauzy dream sequence of a four-year “bully pulpit.” The check on lawless, shifting bullying has always been and will continue to be the judicial branch. But when the history books try to explain why the courts mattered most in the Drumpf era, I hope they note this as well: The judicial branch served as great check not only on Trumpism but for our sanity, each time a judge affirmed that, God be thanked, words and language still do have meaning and consequences.",

      "text" : "Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Washington And The World How Trump’s Syria strike got even some key Obama advisers cheering. By Susan B. GlasserApril 07, 2017Is this the week Donald Trump found a foreign policy? Or a foreign policy found him?President Trump bombed Syria, talked tough on North Korea, dumped his chief political ideologist, Steve Bannon, from his National Security Council, opened up a rift with Russia over the Middle East, and summited with the leaders of Egypt, Jordan and China.Story Continued BelowAmid the head-spinning drumbeat of new developments, few doubted that Trump had made what conservative commentator Byron York called a “whiplash-inducing change” in his administration’s foreign policy, by all accounts impulsively jumping into a Syrian quagmire he had long pledged to avoid, and doing so in response to the televised barbarity of a chemical attack just days after his own top advisers publicly declared they were no longer interested in forcing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad from power.Ever since his shocking election upset victory in November, national security hands have been waiting for Trump’s first international crisis to understand more about how an untested president would lead, and this week will undoubtedly be studied as key to decoding his presidency’s emerging—and fast-evolving—approach to the world. So what have we learned from all the months of debating whether Trump will prove to be the “America First” neo-isolationist leader his campaign rhetoric suggested, or a dangerous warmonger who’s promised not to let the United States get pushed around anymore, now that the crisis has actually erupted?First and perhaps most important: No matter how Trump ultimately comes out of the foreign-policy ideology test, what he really seems to want to be on the world stage is the not-Obama. And when faced with a choice, the best way to understand what Trump will do is to expect he will opt to differentiate himself as much as possible from his predecessor.“He’s proved he’s not Obama—and that’s useful to him,” one former senior Obama official told me, one of many veterans of the previous administration I spoke with Friday who were supportive of Trump’s airstrike on Syria. Indeed, the one thing in common among all Trump’s statements this week was that each contained a strong element of Obama-bashing, whether it was lamenting the “mess” he inherited in the Middle East and North Korea in a Wednesday appearance at the side of Jordan’s King Abdullah or his dramatic late-night Thursday announcement that he was doing what Obama would not by bombing Syria to retaliate for a horrific chemical weapons attack. It was necessary, Trump noted pointedly, because “years of previous attempts” to stop such behavior by Assad had all “failed.”At a time when so much remains uncertain about Trump’s approach to the world, and when it is far too soon to conclude, after one Tomahawk missile barrage against a single Syrian air base, that he’s abandoned his previous insistence that America not act as the world’s policeman, his I’m-not-Obama stance may well be the most consistent theme of Trump’s foreign policy so far. Several Republicans who’ve had extensive contact with Trump and his foreign policy team in recent months have told me they believe this to be the key to understanding Trump’s approach not only to the Syria chemical weapons attack but to many seemingly confounding foreign policy causes Trump has taken up: from the near-impossible task of trying again to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians after Obama-brokered talks went nowhere, to reaching out to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a time when he and Obama were barely on speaking terms. Washington and the World By Blake HounshellWhether it represents a new strategic approach to the world or merely a snap political decision to act decisively where Obama would not, Washington foreign policy hands—in both parties—were widespread in praising Trump for doing what they believed Obama should have done many years ago. Though there were notable exceptions on both the left and the right, the praise from much of the American national security establishment was so lavish in the immediate aftermath of the bombing that at times you could be forgiven for wondering: Did Donald Trump just join the hawkish Beltway mob that Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes so dismissively called The Blob?“Great move.” “Brilliant.” “Finally!” were some of the comments I heard from veteran foreign policy hands in both parties Friday morning. Elliott Abrams, the Reagan and Bush veteran rebuffed by Trump to be his deputy secretary of state, took to The Weekly Standard website to laud the president who wouldn’t hire him as having proved this week he “finally accepted the role of Leader of the Free World.”Just a few days earlier, when news of the Syrian chemical attack broke and Trump’s team said nothing much, Senator John McCain, the Republican who has emerged as the leader of his party’s tough-on-Trump faction, had called their response “another disgraceful chapter in American history.” By Friday, McCain was praising the president, consulting with him and his team and promising the action heralded the “beginning” of a renewed involvement in the troubled Middle East. Politics By Ben SchreckingerMany of the most head-snapping comments I heard came from Obama’s own top advisers, who had long pushed him to confront Assad more aggressively and viewed his 2013 refusal to take military action against Syria after drawing a “red line” on chemical weapons use as a major American foreign policy debacle. There’s no love lost for Trump in this group, whose members found themselves in the uncomfortable position of cheering a leader they still both loathe and fear.“Our administration never would have gotten this done in 48 hours,” one former senior official of the Obama administration told me. “It’s a complete indictment of Obama.”“I feel like finally we have done the right thing,” Anne-Marie Slaughter, who served as Obama’s first-term chief of policy planning at the State Department and long publicly urged a more forceful response to Assad’s horrific attacks on civilians during the six years of war that have wracked Syria, told me. “The years of hypocrisy just hurt us all. It undermined the U.S., it undermined the world order.”Slaughter, now the head of the New America Foundation and a major backer of Trump’s defeated opponent Hillary Clinton last November, tweeted, “Donald Trump has done the right thing on Syria. Finally!! After years of useless handwringing in the face of atrocities.” I later asked her if it was awkward to be cheering for Trump now. “I’m just glad to see it,” she said. “It was the right thing.” The Friday Cover By Caleb HannanBut if it was clear that Trump had played the Blob masterfully Friday, it was less clear what his Syria decision would mean for his broader strategic goals, especially as the day went on with increasingly tough criticism directed at Washington from Moscow, where Putin has been propping up the Assad regime over the past few years and sees his stepped-up presence in Syria as the key that has unlocked an enhanced role for Russia throughout the Middle East.The Russia factor makes the Trump pivot of recent days all the more striking, given Trump’s refusal to criticize Putin even amid the escalating U.S. political scandal here in Washington over Trump and his team’s Russian entanglements. A few months ago, when I spoke with current and former senior U.S. government officials, they worried to me about the Trump team’s initial orders to Russia hands inside the government to look for elements of a “grand bargain” with Moscow that could include lifting sanctions imposed after their invasion of Ukraine and enhanced cooperation in Syria against anti-Assad elements.Russian officials were so confident after Trump’s election they openly talked at European policy forums about the possibility of making a “Yalta 2” deal with the new American president to carve out new spheres of influence in the mode of Franklin Roosevelt’s end of World War II summit arrangement with Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Washington and the World By Colin H. KahlInstead, just 75 days into Trump’s presidency, Putin is calling Trump’s Syrian intervention a “serious blow” to the U.S.-Russian relationship and Trump critics back in Washington are saying for the first time that if Putin intervened in the American election to help Trump, he might not have gotten what he bargained for. All of which means that Trump’s untested new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, will head for his first meeting in Moscow on Wednesday with the entire relationship under a cloud.But that’s where another fact about Trump’s foreign policy comes in—one that may well prove to be as important as his I’m-not-Obama instincts: the hawkish, Pentagon-tinged nature of the team advising him. With Trump new to the complexities of international superpowerdom, his White House national security team under Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster and Defense Department run by Gen. Jim Mattis have emerged as the forces to watch in the new administration, and both are seen as tough-minded veterans of the post-9/11 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan whose views fit well within the GOP mainstream. THE GLOBAL POLITICO By Susan B. Glasser“These are the people who are going to be talking to him and explaining global events and presenting options, and it’s a much more traditional Republican foreign policy,” said Vali Nasr, an early Obama State Department adviser-turned-critic who is now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “That leaves the president himself to say: Will I be more the ‘America First’ president I promised during the campaign, or more of the ‘indispensable nation’” leader that American presidents have seen themselves to be since the end of the Cold War?Then again, it’s entirely unclear that Trump thinks about his foreign policy in anything like those terms. Trump is all about winning and losing, who’s up and who’s down. It’s why he still obsesses at every turn about the close results from his election victory over Hillary Clinton. And why, increasingly now that he’s in the Oval Office, the person he most wants to beat these days is Barack Obama.Susan B. Glasser is POLITICO’s chief international affairs columnist.

Embed Copy Share Play Video2:50 (Jorge Ribas/The Washington Post) Maya Warren works two jobs, as a home health worker, and an Uber driver. But without any maternity leave, she had to go back to work less than a week after giving birth. Maya Warren works two jobs, as a home health worker, and an Uber driver. But without any maternity leave, she had to go back to work less than a week after giving birth. (Video: Jorge Ribas/Photo: Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) Maya Warren sat in a hospital bed, clutching her stomach. Through the contractions, she tried to focus on the baby. But she thought instead of her bank account. “Hand me my backpack,” Warren told her mother, crouched at her bedside. Earlier that November day, she had paid a dollar for a scratch-off card, worth up to $777. Now she scraped away the silver. “Oh, damn it,” Warren said, wiping sweat from her forehead. “I didn’t win.” “How you gonna be in labor and scratch on a scratch-off?” her mother teased. Warren laughed, blinking back tears. Maya Warren scratches off a lotto ticket in between contractions as she waits for her son to be born. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) She wasn’t supposed to give birth to her first child with no money. She had held the same full-time job in Washington for five years, living paycheck to paycheck. She’d wanted to stash away some financial cushion, and now . . . “We needed that,” she said, flinging away the worthless card. “We needed that.” Like an estimated quarter of working mothers in the United States, Warren will return to work less than two weeks after childbirth, whether she’s ready or not. That’s partly because the United States is the only industrialized nation not to guarantee any paid time off to new parents. For years, Democrats have championed a stronger safety net, one that would replace lost wages as life’s expenses surge. Republicans have called such a federal mandate a “job killer” that would burden businesses. During the campaign, however, Donald Drumpf became the first Republican presidential nominee to pitch a national paid family leave program, proposing new mothers could apply for the benefit through the country’s un­employment insurance system. Now his older daughter Ivanka, recently installed as a West Wing adviser, is tasked with aiding the administration’s push to turn the idea into law. Meanwhile, low-income women are exploring their own alternatives to paid maternity leave, with some turning to the gig economy. But for Warren, a lottery ticket still seems a better bet. Maya Warren visits her doctor's office for a checkup before giving birth at Providence Hospital in Washington. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) $20,000 a year Maya Warren, who turned 32 last week, is a home health aide for Maxim Healthcare Services, a medical staffing company in Washington. She gives elderly patients baths and reminds them to take their pills. She monitors their comfort, fluffing pillows and pouring glasses of water. As an hourly worker, she usually earns about $300 a week. Even with overtime, her annual pay of about $20,000 last year ranks her among America’s working poor. Warren accepted the job because she sees herself as a natural caretaker. After high school, she took general education classes at a community college before landing at an air force base, watching kids at a day-care center. She quit to tend to her cancer-stricken grandfather — “my favorite person,” she called him. She stayed with him until he landed in hospice. For those two years, to make ends meet, she worked at a nightclub in Maryland. In 2010, Warren googled “home health aide jobs,” found Maxim and scored an interview. She didn’t think to ask about benefits. She prioritized a regular schedule. She can’t rely on much help from her baby’s father, who she said lacks steady income. She sees herself as a single mother. The country provides one protection to bread-winning parents, and it comes with caveats. The Family Medical Leave Act, enacted in 1993, ensures workers can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave after a birth, as long as they’ve logged at least a year at a company that employs more than 50 people. Some businesses cover the gap: As of 2016, 58 percent of firms replace at least some wages during maternity leave, and 12 percent do the same for paternity leave. Moms and dads who lack paid family leave typically rely on savings or loans or credit cards to get by. An estimated 30 percent of workers who take leave slip into debt, according to a 2012 federal survey. Myra Strober, a labor economist at Stanford University, says low-income parents are the least likely to have any paid leave — and the most likely to encounter financial hardship as their family grows. “They’re easier to replace,” Strober said. “The employer hasn’t had to invest much in training that worker.” According to the Labor Department’s latest breakdown, construction workers are the least likely to receive paid family leave (5 percent can get it), followed by hospitality workers (6 percent), utility laborers (7 percent) and those in the service industry (8 percent). In education and health services — the category into which Warren’s job falls — 19 percent of such laborers have the benefit. Maxim, her employer, has roughly 60,000 workers across the country and doesn’t provide paid family leave to home health aides, a profession with a median annual wage of $21,920. Maxim declined to comment on Warren’s situation or why it does not provide paid family leave. The company said, “Maxim follows strong and appropriate policies to ensure that all employees — including pregnant employees — are treated fairly and protected from discrimination.” The company gives workers the chance to buy temporary disability insurance, a spokesperson said, and the cost “depends on the amount of coverage selected.” For Warren, that would have been $300 monthly. She felt she couldn’t afford it. She was at work when pain gripped her lower belly. She blamed the fibroids, the tumor-like masses that crowded her uterus. She had dealt with them for seven years. This time, though, the discomfort led her to the emergency room, a visit her Medicaid insurance would cover. She told the doctor about the fibroids. The doctor told her the baby was fine. The baby? She didn’t think she could get pregnant. Her condition made it tough to conceive and carry a child, according to her googling. Disbelief gave way to joy. This was it: her chance to become a mother. All at once, the scramble to save money began. A campaign promise Two months before Election Day, before a suburban Philadelphia crowd, Drumpf unveiled his plan for paid maternity leave. He credited Ivanka Drumpf, a mother of three, with inspiring the idea. He also was polling poorly among female voters (and ended up losing among women to Hillary Clinton by 12 percentage points). As president, Drumpf said, he would open the unemployment insurance system to new mothers. Currently, the state-run programs float cash only to laid-off workers. Under his policy, the average weekly maternity benefit, per his campaign, would be roughly $300 for up to six weeks — enough to replace Warren’s lost wages. She could apply for the aid with a recent pay stub. Adoptive parents and fathers, according to Drumpf’s blueprint, wouldn’t qualify. Democrats slammed his proposal as too narrow. Republicans, for their part, generally don’t support expanding entitlements, saying it is costly to taxpayers and likely to add to the national debt. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), for example, has voted against paid leave programs, ­instead supporting measures that would allow workers to accumulate time off in lieu of overtime pay. “I don’t think that sticking up for being a person with balance in your life, for wanting to spend your weekends in your home with your family . . . I don’t think that means signing up for some new unfunded mandate,” Ryan told CNN in a 2015 interview. (He hasn’t commented on Drumpf’s plan.) Some business leaders, especially at small firms, would rather not absorb the cost. But others see the value in offering the benefit, since research has shown it can increase worker loyalty and reduce turnover. Drumpf said the plan wouldn’t cost an extra penny, that he would fund it by quashing fraud in the unemployment insurance system, which government estimates put at $3.2 billion in 2015. That, Drumpf said, would be more than enough to support his program, priced at $2.5 billion. However, no more than $900 million of the overpayments — benefits sent to deceased or employed folks, for example — were clawed back in 2015. The president hasn’t mentioned his paid maternity leave plan since taking office, but Ivanka Drumpf has been hosting Republican lawmakers at the White House in an attempt to drum up support for it. As of now, enthusiasm appears to be scarce. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), the left’s de facto leader on paid family leave, has introduced a bill on Capitol Hill that would give new parents, regardless of gender, 12 weeks of paid time off at two-thirds of their pay. To fund the program, workers would give up 0.2 percent of their salary, and employers would match that — an average contribution of $2 a week, she said. The paid leave movement is spreading. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island all cover wage loss for new parents, and San Francisco, New York and the District have approved similar measures. New parents without the public benefits rely on employer generosity or family members or luck. Warren threw herself into work. Hours — and money — dry up Maya Warren visits a pawn shop in Suitland, Md., to make a payment on a ring she pawned. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) Before Warren’s pregnancy started to show, she said, her home health aide shifts began dwindling — from five a week to three, sometimes two. Maxim said that, in general, hours depend on demand. “Because they are paid by the hour, full- or part-time employment status is driven by a combination of client need and employee preference,” the company said. Warren’s weekly pay shrank to $150. The expenses — for food, gas, her $400 monthly rent, clothes for her growing body, baby wipes, the occasional manicure when life felt heavy — piled up even as she tried to save. She needed a side hustle. Warren knew people who drove for Uber and enjoyed the extra cash, so she pawned a gold ring to rent a car through the ride-sharing service. For one payment of $350, she could drive away in a Nissan Altima. Then $215 would be deducted each week from her Uber paycheck. If she didn’t drive enough to cover the payments, Uber’s partner in the deal, Enterprise, would charge her card on file. In Washington, Uber drivers pull about $15 an hour, on average, according to Glassdoor salary data. Because they’re contractors, though, the money arrives pretax, so Warren would have to remember to set aside some earnings for Uncle Sam. She signed the contract. By October, Warren planned to care for her patients by day and morph into a chauffeur at night. She aimed for 75 rides each week. Maya Warren holds Kortez Isaiah Wallace. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) She still owed about $5,000 in student loans, $500 from old hospital visits and $300 in overdue cellphone bills. Debt had trailed her for years, and interest swelled over time. She wanted to pay it all off before the baby came. Banish the collectors, the stress. But the week before Warren went into labor, a cashier at Chick-fil-A said her debit card had been declined. She prayed it was a mistake, but deep down, she knew: The cash was gone. She couldn’t even buy a chicken sandwich. Warren went into labor at the end of November, right after she had moved back in with her mother in Southeast Washington. The baby didn’t budge for two nights, so the doctor advised a Caesarean section. Some 90 minutes later, he eased into her arms. She cupped his tiny feet. She kissed his nose. She named him Kortez Isaiah. It was a major surgery. The doctor recommended 12 weeks of rest — four more than usual because of her fibroids. Again, Warren thought of money. She had a car seat from a Capitol Hill charity, a breast pump from her neighbor, a bassinet from her mom, and food stamps. She had been driving for Uber as much as she thought she could. From Oct. 10 to Nov. 21, according to her pay statements, she had banked $1,458 — an average weekly wage of $243. That barely covered the rental cost. Not to mention the gas. Back to work Maya Warren drives days before giving birth as an Uber driver in Washington. (Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) Six days after leaving the hospital, Warren sat at her mother’s kitchen table, staring at her car keys. Kortez slept nearby in his bassinet. Home health aide shifts — eight-hour days on her feet — were out of the question. Her boss had told her to come back after six weeks. Driving, Warren thought, was probably a better option — though the doctor had told her not to slide behind the wheel for two weeks. She would not take any pills for the pain. Her mom, she thought, had been so generous. Without her, Warren figured she would be homeless. She was breast-feeding Kortez, so baby food came free. Soon, though, they would run out of diapers. She wanted to be the one to buy more. She hadn’t gotten her mom’s ring back, either. She wondered if it was still at the pawnshop. Warren stood up. Her swollen stomach burned. Every step brought a new jolt. “Ow,” she would say to no one. She put on her black jacket with a faux-fur hood. She shuffled to her mother’s driveway. She opened the car door (“ow”), eased into the driver’s seat (“ow”) and started the engine (“ow”). Warren picked up a woman with a suitcase who wanted to go to a house in Temple Hills, Md. — a 15-minute ride. That would net her $7.03. She willed herself to ignore the bumps in the road.

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — Relationships have always been President Trump’s currency and comfort, helping him talk his way into real estate deals over three decades in New York. Those who know him best say that his outer confidence has always belied an inner uncertainty, and that he needs to test ideas with a wide range of people.As Mr. Trump’s White House advisers jostle for position, the president has turned to another group of advisers — from family, real estate, media, finance and politics, and all outside the White House gates — many of whom he consults at least once a week.The media mogul Rupert Murdoch is on the phone every week, encouraging Mr. Trump when he’s low and arguing that he focus on the economy rather than detouring to other issues. The developer Richard LeFrak is a soothing voice who listens to Mr. Trump’s complaints that cost estimates for the border wall with Mexico are too high. Sean Hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core Republican issues is crucial.Mr. Trump’s West Wing aides, like President Bill Clinton’s staff two decades before, say they sometimes cringe at the input from people they can’t control, with consequences they can’t predict. Knowing these advisers — who are mostly white, male and older — is a key to figuring out the words coming from Mr. Trump’s mouth and his Twitter feed.Here, based on interviews with more than a dozen friends, top aides and advisers inside and outside the White House, are 20 of Mr. Trump’s outside touchstones.Rupert MurdochMr. Trump’s relationships depend on two crucial measures: personal success and loyalty to him. Mr. Murdoch excels in both categories. His New York Post vaulted Mr. Trump from local housing developer to gossip-page royalty, and his Fox News Channel was pro-Trump in the 2016 general election.The two share preferences for transactional tabloid journalism and never giving in to critics. (Mr. Trump said the fallen Fox star Bill O’Reilly should not have settled sexual harassment complaints.) The president’s relationship with Mr. Murdoch is deeper and more enduring than most in his life, and the two commiserate and plot strategy in their phone calls, according to people close to both.Mr. Murdoch even called the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, to buck him up after Mr. Spicer was savaged for a remark about Adolf Hitler.Sean HannityPresidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points, but Mr. Trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like Mr. Hannity who also serve as advisers. Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, defends Mr. Trump’s most controversial behavior in public, but privately, according to people close to Mr. Trump, he urges the president not to get distracted, and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the Affordable Care Act.Chris RuddyThe chief executive of Newsmax Media is a longtime Mar-a-Lago member and was a Trump cheerleader among conservative media well before the website Breitbart joined the parade. He employs writers and editors who tracked Mr. Trump’s career when they were at The New York Post. He recently visited the Oval Office, and he and Mr. Trump kibitz in Florida and by phone.Sheri A. DillonMs. Dillon seemed out of place when she spoke at a too-large lectern in the lobby of Trump Tower on Jan. 11, describing the steps Mr. Trump planned to take to separate himself from his business. But Ms. Dillon, an ethics lawyer who worked out a highly criticized plan for Mr. Trump to retain ownership of his company but step back from running it, has repeatedly counseled the president about the business and made at least one White House visit. (Michael Cohen, a veteran Trump aide, has been serving as his personal lawyer.)Corey LewandowskiDespite his “you’re fired” slogan, the president dislikes dismissing people. Mr. Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s hot-tempered first campaign manager, was fired in June but never really went away. A New England-bred operative whose working-class roots and clenched-teeth loyalty earned him Mr. Trump’s trust, he continued to be in frequent phone contact with Mr. Trump until the election and beyond. Friends of Mr. Lewandowski say that he can see the windows of the White House residence from his lobbying office on Pennsylvania Avenue, and that the view is even better during his visits to the West Wing, including when the New England Patriots were there this past week.Newt GingrichThe former House speaker talks more with Mr. Trump’s top advisers than he does with the president, but his presence permeates the administration. Mr. Gingrich’s former spokesman is at the State Department, and two former advisers work in the West Wing. Mr. Gingrich has relentlessly promoted Mr. Trump’s policy adviser, Stephen Miller, as the West Wing conservative ballast as the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has been under fire.Richard LeFrakTheir fathers were developers together in New York, and the two men have been friends for decades. Mr. LeFrak is a Mar-a-Lago member, and he agreed to be part of an infrastructure effort that Mr. Trump hopes to put forward. Mr. Trump has turned to him to vent frustrations about the slow pace of bureaucracy.Thomas Barrack Jr.Mr. Trump divides the people around him into broad categories: family, paid staff and wealthy men like Mr. Barrack whom he considers peers. A sunny and loyal near-billionaire who has socialized with the president for years, Mr. Barrack is less a strategic adviser than a trusted moneyman, fixer and sounding board who has often punctuated emails to Mr. Trump with exhortations like “YOU ROCK!” He has urged Mr. Trump to avoid needless, distracting fights.Under Mr. Barrack’s leadership, Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee raised a record $106.7 million, much of it from big corporations, banks and Republican megadonors like the Las Vegas billionaire Sheldon Adelson. Mr. Barrack also helped usher Paul Manafort, the international political operative now under scrutiny for his ties to Russia, into the Trump fold last year. The velvet-voiced Mr. Barrack does not seek out attention for himself, one of the most important and elusive qualities by which the president judges people.Stephen SchwarzmanThe chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, Mr. Schwarzman is the head of Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council. He and the president don’t speak daily, West Wing aides said, but do talk frequently. Mr. Schwarzman has counseled him on a number of topics, including advising him to leave in place President Barack Obama’s executive order shielding young undocumented immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” from deportation.Steve RothA good way to get on Mr. Trump’s side is to do a deal with him, particularly if it means rescuing him from his own financial crisis. That’s what Mr. Roth, a real estate tycoon, did a decade ago when he bought out Mr. Trump’s share in a West Side real estate deal that went sour. Mr. Roth, head of Vornado Realty Trust and a longtime Democratic donor, also helped Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, when he injected $80 million into 666 Fifth Avenue, a Kushner family property in danger of defaulting on $1.1 billion in loans. Mr. Trump speaks with Mr. Roth frequently, and is leaning on him to help develop a trillion-dollar infrastructure package expected this year.Phil RuffinMr. Trump has 20-odd business partners, but none is closer to him than Mr. Ruffin, 82, a Texas billionaire who has lent his ear and private jet. The president was best man at the 2008 wedding of Mr. Ruffin to his third wife, a 26-year-old model and former Miss Ukraine. Mr. Ruffin has a knack for showing up when Mr. Trump needs him most and remains a die-hard defender. “This stuff about him having financial investments all over Russia — that’s just pure crap,” Mr. Ruffin told Forbes. “I went to Russia with him. We took my airplane. We were having lunch with one of the oligarchs there. No business was discussed.”Carl IcahnRounding out Mr. Trump’s roster of wealthy octogenarians is this 81-year-old corporate raider and real estate mogul, who occupies perhaps the most respected perch in the president’s circle of businessmen buddies. The affection is longstanding: The Queens-bred Mr. Icahn has known Mr. Trump and his family for decades. It’s also numerical: Mr. Icahn is worth an estimated $16 billion, a major plus in the eyes of a president who keeps score. Mr. Icahn serves as a free-roving economic counselor and the head of Mr. Trump’s effort to reduce government regulations on business.Roger J. Stone Jr.Few alliances in politics are as complicated as the 40-year relationship between the Nixon-tattooed Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump. Mr. Stone won’t say how frequently they speak these days, but he shares the president’s tear-down-the-system impulses and is ubiquitous on cable news, radio and the website InfoWars defending Mr. Trump.Ike PerlmutterMr. Perlmutter, the chief executive of Marvel Comics, who is so reclusive that there are few public photographs of him, has been informally advising Mr. Trump on veterans issues. The two men are old friends, and Mr. Perlmutter has been a presence at Mar-a-Lago.Robert KraftThe owner of the New England Patriots is a Democrat, but his loyalty to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kraft once said, dates partly to the president’s thoughtfulness when Mr. Kraft’s father died. Mr. Trump loved talking about the Patriots during the campaign, and Mr. Kraft has been a Mar-a-Lago presence since the transition.Melania TrumpMrs. Trump is uninterested in the limelight, but she has remained a powerful adviser by telephone from New York. Among her roles: giving Mr. Trump feedback on media coverage, counseling him on staff choices and urging him, repeatedly, to tone down his Twitter feed. Lately, he has listened closely, and has a more disciplined Twitter finger.Chris ChristieMr. Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and palace gatekeeper, has shown a capacity to hobble his rivals, but few have been finished off. The most durable has been Mr. Christie, whose transition planning, several West Wing aides now concede, should not have been discarded. He has been a frequent Oval Office visitor and has worked with the White House on the opioid addiction crisis.Paul D. RyanMr. Trump and the clean-cut and wonky Wisconsinite aren’t exactly best friends forever. But their relationship is closer than in the bad old days of the 2016 campaign when Mr. Ryan delayed a hold-my-nose endorsement of Mr. Trump, whose morality he had long questioned. But as the president’s agenda passes through the razor-blade gantlet of the House, where Mr. Ryan faces the constant threat of opposition and overthrow, the two men have become foxhole buddies.Donald Trump Jr. and Eric TrumpThe two sons and the president insist they no longer discuss company business. But the family is close, and Mr. Trump still speaks to his sons frequently, inquiring about their lives and searching for gut-checks on his own.",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — The White House accused the Russian government on Tuesday of engaging in a cover-up of the chemical weapons attack last week by Syrian forces that prompted American missile strikes, saying that United States intelligence and numerous contemporaneous reports confirmed that the Syrians used sarin gas on their own people.In a declassified four-page report that details United States intelligence on the chemical weapons attack and contains a point-by-point rebuttal of Moscow’s claims, the White House asserted that the Syrian and Russian governments had sought to confuse the world community about the assault through disinformation and “false narratives.”The strongly worded document calls for international condemnation of Syria’s use of chemical weapons and harshly criticizes Russia for “shielding” an ally that has used weapons of mass destruction.It marks a striking shift by President Trump, who entered office praising President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and seeking common ground with him — and now appears to be moving swiftly to isolate him. The charges came as Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, was preparing for meetings in Moscow on Wednesday, and as Congress and the F.B.I. are investigating potential ties between Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia.“Russia is in an island on this,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said. He said there was little dispute about Syria’s responsibility for the attack — except by Moscow and the “failed states” of North Korea and Iran.“This is not exactly a happy-time cocktail party of people you want to be associated with,” he said.Senior White House officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the government’s view, said Russia’s goal was to cover up the Syrian government’s culpability for the chemical attack. They asserted that the Syrian government, under pressure from opposition forces in the strategically vital Hama Province and lacking sufficient troops to respond, used the lethal nerve agent sarin to retaliate against rebels who were threatening government-held territory.Neither Mr. Spicer nor any of the officials who detailed the United States government’s chronology of the chemical attack would comment on the possibility that the Russian government had known in advance of Syria’s plan to carry it out, or to launch a subsequent assault on a hospital that was treating victims.But one official said that, given the history of close cooperation between the Syrian and Russian militaries, and that Russian forces were stationed at Al Shayrat airfield, which was used to launch the chemical attack, Moscow must answer.“Moscow’s response to the April 4 attack follows a familiar pattern of its responses to other egregious actions,” the report said. “It spins out multiple, conflicting accounts in order to create confusion and sow doubt within the international community.”Much of the report was devoted to rebutting Russia’s claim that the chemical attack last week was actually the result of a Syrian airstrike against a terrorist ammunition depot in Khan Sheikhoun that contained chemical weapons. The report also cited a video and commercial satellite imagery that showed that the chemical weapon had landed in the middle of a road, not at a weapons facility.White House officials said United States intelligence agencies do not believe that the Islamic State or other terrorist groups have sarin gas.The report also rejected Moscow’s claim that the April 4 attack was a “prank of a provocative nature” and denied Russian suggestions that the substance used might not have been sarin.“Victims of the attack on April 4 displayed telltale symptoms of nerve agent exposure, including pinpoint pupils, foaming at the nose and mouth, and twitching,” the report said.",

      "text" : "The story that landed on Arlene Schneider’s desk was a Frugal Traveler column about the bars and clubs of South Beach, Fla., and her job was to write the headline that would appear in print.Her solution? “Tonight I’m Gonna Party Like It’s $19.99.”“That one took me no time at all,” said Ms. Schneider, who has spent most of her 18-year tenure at The Times as a copy editor. “It was a gift. I just typed it out.” (The headline would help earn her a second-place award for headline writing, announced last month, from ACES, the copy editors’ society.)Readers often assume that reporters write their own headlines. In fact, they rarely do. Most headlines at The Times, print headlines in particular, are written by editors experienced in the task. “I think of it as a puzzle,” Ms. Schneider said. “You have to condense the essence of a story into a very finite space, and you’re governed by — well, by a laundry list of rules.”The guidelines are daunting: Get at the crux of the story, but don’t give away the ending. Use slang sparingly, and always avoid tabloid-like provocation. If a headline runs more than a single line, don’t end a line with a preposition, an adjective or an article (“a” or “the”) — and, while you’re at it, make the lines roughly equal in length. Also, don’t pilfer (“step on”) a savory nugget from the “lede” (the top) or the “kicker” (the bottom) of the story.Above all else, avoid cheap punning. “Lots of newspapers rely on bad puns,” Ms. Schneider said. “For headline writers at The Times, employing a bad pun is a mortal sin.”(The Times’s style guide offers a colorful elucidation: Obvious wordplay, such as Rubber Industry Bounces Back, “should be tested on a trusted colleague the way mine shaft air is tested on a canary. When no song bursts forth, start rewriting.”)Instead, The Times aims for something more restrained. And humor, when it surfaces, is often of the wry, witty variety. “Finding the right tone is one of the most important things,” said Sean Ernst, who, as an assistant news editor, often writes headlines, captions and other display type for the printed paper. “It’s a disservice to both the reader and the reporter if a serious news article is accompanied by a headline that’s too flippant. On the other hand, if a story is light or offbeat, you don’t want a headline that’s stiff or boring.” (For an especially cold N.F.L. playoff game, Mr. Ernst penned the following: “49ers Feel Joy, if Not Their Toes.”)Using a startling quotation can be effective, as can singling out a particularly salient number or fact, said Mark Bulik, a senior editor who writes a weekly in-house report on successful headlines. Personalizing a story can also be helpful, he added.“But the main things are simply vivid wording, a conversational tone and internal tension,” he said. (“Internal tension,” he explained, “is when two elements of the headline are at odds, creating a mystery that can only be solved by reading further.” An example from a recent business story: “Meet the Shareholders? Not at These Shareholder Meetings.”)Contextual considerations matter too. “We try to work with the accompanying photos,” Ms. Schneider said, “to make everything fit together as a package.”The context a printed paper provides is a big part of what separates print headlines from digital ones. Unless an obituary is the top one on a page, for example, its print headline should not state that the subject has died; a reader can infer as much, given where the article appears. Its digital headline, however, invariably includes explicit mention of the death.Optimizing digital headlines for search results also accounts for differences. Editors try to incorporate key terms, including the names of some people who might be too obscure to land in a print headline.But the goal for both platforms is the same: headlines that will reach and draw in as many people as possible. And that often requires hard work.Except, of course, when it doesn’t.“Many of my memorable headlines simply came to me in a flash,” Ms. Schneider said. “I could have thought all day about them, and it wouldn’t have done me any good at all.”",

Leave aside the humanitarian and strategic consequences: Trump’s decision to launch cruise missiles at Syria was a tactical political masterstroke worthy of Vladimir Putin. The Syria strike shattered the political coalitions gathered against Trump and assembled new ones from the pieces.First and foremost, Trump won over the blob. The mainstream U.S. foreign policy community has harbored deep misgivings about Trump since the early days of his candidacy. But they certainly weren’t happy about Obama, either, especially when it came to Syria. In recent days, a number of former Obama officials have retroactively criticized his decision not to intervene in Syria, both on and, most colorfully, off the record. Related Story What's Next in Syria? Obama saw this coming. In an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, he denounced the traditional formulas of American power. “There’s a playbook in Washington that presidents are supposed to follow,” Obama said. “The playbook prescribes responses to different events, and these responses tend to be militarized responses.” But, he explained, “In the midst of an international challenge like Syria, you get judged harshly if you don’t follow the playbook.”In attacking Syria, Trump saw the political utility of playing by the rules once again. A foreign-policy community weary of its antagonism to the grand office of the president would snap in line behind him. And snap in it did, just as soon as the cable networks broke in with somber anchors explaining that America was, once again, unleashing its arsenal over Middle Eastern skies.Trump’s moves allow him to draw a sharp line between himself and Obama, winning over many critics from the heart of the American foreign policy mainstream. The Senate’s two key Republican foreign policy voices, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, issued a statement in strong support of the strike, noting that Trump had marked a distinction from the Obama administration and begun establishing U.S. credibility. A leader of the conservative Never Trump movement, Bill Kristol, tweeted that he could support the action if not the man: “He’s the president, not merely ‘Trump.’”Even the centrist and liberal wings of the blob turned out for Trump. Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a blob leader if ever one existed, noted that acting where Obama didn’t gave Trump the chance to define himself as the “new sheriff.” Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former Obama official who has advocated intervention in Syria in the past, said bluntly: “Donald Trump has done the right thing on Syria.” Even Hillary Clinton was supportive of the action in remarks she made before the strike.As a bonus, Trump managed to shed support from a particularly troublesome wing of his coalition: his ardent allies on the political fringe and the far right. Paul Watson of the xenophobic, conspiracy-mongering outlet InfoWars, declared himself “off the Trump train” and tweeted that he would turn his attentions to France’s Marine Le Pen. For her part, Le Pen seemed uncomfortable with the action, declaring her surprise and saying Trump should have waited for an international investigation. Another pro-Trump, pro-Putin ally, Nigel Farage, also seemed taken aback by the actions of his one-time champion, choosing like Le Pen to declare himself “surprised.” But this group carries little weight on foreign policy and can be won back with some care and a few dog-whistle tweets.Even the centrist and liberal wings of the blob turned out for Trump.Of course, Trump benefited from the groundwork laid by his predecessor. The plan Obama considered for striking Syria was significantly more comprehensive, in part because Syria still maintained the bulk of its chemical weapons stockpiles then. At the time Obama was considering action, Martin Dempsey, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs, wrote that stand-off strikes would require “hundreds of aircraft, ships, submarines, and other enablers. Depending on duration, the costs would be in the billions.” The plan Trump approved looked very different from what Dempsey described, according to a former Obama official: many missiles hitting one largely symbolic target, rather than an effort to hit many targets. Trump didn’t need to achieve the same military effect. He could instead simply do what Tomahawk missiles do best: send a political message.The ability to send a message with a much smaller mission also enabled Trump to minimize the main risk of attacking Syria—collateral damage to Russian forces operating in the country. Russia has fumed in response, to be sure, but it certainly did not activate its air defenses in Syria. A Kremlin statement implied that the chemical attack itself was a ruse effected by the United States to justify interventionism. “The Syrian Army has no chemical weapons,” it said, while the government cut off existing coordination measures with America, ironically by suspending the deconfliction phone line Trump’s military used to warn Russia that the attack was coming. The false-flag message about chemical weapons is also an opening provided by Obama. By working through the destruction process, Obama opened the door for Trump to make Russia pay for violating its promises.The pieces were in place for a politically flexible operator to make a bold stroke. Trump could push just hard enough to move the American establishment into its posture of reflexive support for American credibility, but was able to hit lightly enough not to actually harm its most dangerous adversary. And he could do so while utterly repudiating his predecessor’s position, an opportunity made possible only because of the work done by that predecessor. So what if Trump had denounced Obama’s Syria’s policy and decried George W. Bush’s war-mongering? A tactical opportunity presented itself, and he seized it. Once Putin finishes screaming, he may find himself compelled to applaud.",

      "text" : "PARIS — With a tense battle for the future of France underway ahead of a presidential runoff election next month, the far-right insurgent Marine Le Pen is pulling a page from the same improbable victory playbook as President Trump: encouraging her opponents to stay home. Opinion polls suggest that Le Pen’s opponent, centrist newcomer Emmanuel Macron, holds a commanding lead ahead of the May 7 runoff, less because French voters believe in him than because they are frightened by Le Pen’s National Front, which has long been dogged by charges of anti-Semitism and Nazi sympathies. But in a year when voters are storming the establishment bastions around the world, many mainstream French politicians are warning that Macron’s campaign is dangerously complacent. Despite polls that show Macron sweeping up more than 60 percent of the vote, several post-election missteps have kept the door open to a Le Pen upset, analysts say — even as the path she must walk to the Elysee Palace is vanishingly thin. [What you need to know about Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen] “An election is combat, and it’s necessary to fight,” Ségolène Royal, a senior Socialist leader who has thrown her backing to Macron, told BFMTV. Macron and Le Pen faceoff for French presidency Embed Copy Share Play Video1:59 (The Washington Post) Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old centrist, will face Marine Le Pen, the far-right nationalist in the presidential runoff May 7, leaving French voters with a stark choice. Macron takes on Le Pen for French presidency. Now What? (The Washington Post) Macron, who was economy minister until August, is a 39-year-old former investment banker who has never held elected office. His unorthodox campaign platform mixes ideas from the left and right — but above all is a cheerful endorsement of the idea that a borderless, globalized world is the best way to ensure prosperity for France’s citizens. But the political neophyte’s path to the doorstep of the presidency has been eased by the failures of his traditional party rivals. A corruption scandal downed center-right candidate François Fillon, who was otherwise considered a shoo-in. The incumbent president, Socialist François Hollande, is historically unpopular, destroying his party’s chances of a second term. Now Le Pen’s victory chances depend on disillusioned left-wing voters staying home, holding down the total voting pool enough for her to top 50 percent. With nearly half of French voters opting for anti-establishment candidates in Sunday’s first-round vote, there is a slender possibility it could happen, even if it’s unlikely. An upset would have some of the echoes of Trump’s victory. Far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, whose anti-globalization agenda had many shades of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign, has held back from calling on his supporters to vote for Macron to deny the far-right a victory. [Marine Le Pen goes from fringe right-winger to major contender] Le Pen’s campaign has seized on Mélenchon’s wavering, pushing out a point-by-point comparison of their campaign positions, many of which share a skepticism of globalization and big business. Many of Mélenchon’s supporters resent the pressure to vote for Macron, saying that even if they loathe Le Pen’s attitude toward foreigners, her centrist opponent embodies all of the globalist, pro-business stances they detest. Le Pen accuses Macron of being 'weak' on terrorism Embed Copy Share Play Video1:26 (Reuters) Far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen told reporters, April 24, that her opponent, independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, does not having a plan to protect against the \"danger of Islamist terrorism.\" Far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen says her opponent, Emmanuel Macron, does not having a plan to protect against \"Islamist terrorism.\" (Reuters) “What really bothers me the most is the amount of unanimity,” said Antoine Hémon, 30, a PhD student in economics who worked on Mélenchon’s campaign. “As though it were a parlor reflex, saying you have to vote for Macron in order to build a rampart against Le Pen.” He said he was still making up his mind about how — or whether — to vote in the runoff. “On Sunday I was in favor of voting blank,” casting an empty ballot as a protest against the system, he said. “On Monday I was in favor of voting Macron.” Now he’s thinking about abstaining, he said, although “if there’s the slightest chance that the fascists come to power,” he said, referring to Le Pen, he’ll probably reconsider. Even if Macron wins, a narrow victory will sap his momentum going into June legislative elections and could make it difficult for him to enact his agenda. And if France’s unemployment remains stranded at 10 percent and economic growth stays disappointing, Le Pen could return stronger than ever in the next elections in 2022. “He will have to dramatize the election in the coming week,” said Vincent Martigny, a professor of politics at École Polytechnique, a university in a suburb of Paris. “It’s not about victory but the type of mandate he wins.” Le Pen has been delighted to exploit her opponent’s missteps. Her skills were on display Wednesday when she seized on a trip by Macron to his home town of Amiens, where workers at a Whirlpool clothes dryer factory have been picketing to protest plans to shutter the plant and move production to Poland. About 290 jobs will be lost, a prospect that has ignited a debate over globalization. [The leading French presidential candidates Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, in their own words] Macron met with a handful of representatives from labor unions in a stuffy, gray-walled conference room in the city’s Chamber of Commerce, taking notes across the conference table and earnestly nodding at their concerns in front of rolling television cameras. It was a classic political set-piece intended to show his solemn dedication to solving workers’ problems. But as the meeting was underway, Le Pen rolled up unannounced in a white passenger van to the striking workers’ encampment at the factory entrance and cheerfully set off a campaign explosion. “The fact that Macron isn’t with the workers here today is a sign of contempt,” Le Pen said, as she was thronged by dozens of strikers in front of a pile of burning tires. “I’m not currently eating petit fours with representatives who actually only represent themselves.” As she hugged appreciative workers one by one, she told them she heard their concerns and would fight for them against the forces of globalization. Some of them started to cry. French television networks aired the powerful split-screen drama, contrasting Le Pen’s earthy appeal with Macron’s policy-wonk note taking. His campaign scrambled to add a stop at the factory, which he had not initially planned to visit. “Ms. Le Pen is playing politics and goes into parking lots and whips up the crowd,” a testy Macron told reporters at the end of his meeting. “I in turn withwill deal with things in depth.” world europe Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

He has given Le Pen a 35 percent chance of winning on May 7, despite polling agencies’ analyses that turnout would need to be significantly lower in the second round in order for Le Pen to stand a chance of taking the election. “If turnout is lower in the second round, and there is more complacency on the far-left and the center-right because of these very reassuring polls, it is just about possible,” Lichfield said.

      "text" : "SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea launched a ballistic missile Sunday morning from near its submarine base in Sinpo on its east coast, but the launch was the latest in a series of failures just after liftoff, according to American and South Korean military officials.The timing was a deep embarrassment for the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, because the missile appeared to have been launched to show off his daring as a fleet of American warships approached his country to deter provocations.Cmdr. Dave Benham, a spokesman for the United States Pacific Command, said the military had “detected and tracked what we assess was a North Korean missile launch at 11:21 a.m. Hawaii time April 15.”The missile blew up almost immediately, and the type of missile involved is still being assessed, he said.Over the past three years, a covert war over the missile program has broken out between North Korea and the United States. As the North’s skills grew, President Barack Obama ordered a surge in strikes against the missile launches, The New York Times reported last month, including through electronic-warfare techniques. It is unclear how successful the program has been, because it is almost impossible to tell whether any individual launch failed because of sabotage, faulty engineering or bad luck. But the North’s launch-failure rate has been extraordinarily high since Mr. Obama first accelerated the program.In an unusually worded statement that left hanging the question of whether the United States played any role in the latest launch’s failure, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said: “The president and his military team are aware of North Korea’s most recent unsuccessful missile launch. The president has no further comment.”Vice President Mike Pence, en route to Seoul, South Korea, for the start of a 10-day trip through Asia, was briefed aboard Air Force Two on the North’s attempt.Mr. Pence was in contact with President Trump about the launch, aides to the vice president told reporters traveling with him as he flew over the Bering Sea. Mr. Pence arrived in South Korea on Sunday afternoon to begin a 10-day trip to Asia that comes amid turmoils over North Korea’s advancing nuclear threats.He was scheduled to meet with Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn of South Korea on Monday to discuss the North Korean menace.Hours before the unsuccessful test, three types of intercontinental ballistic missiles rolled through Pyongyang, the North’s capital, in an annual parade as the country tried to demonstrate that its military reach was expanding at a time of heightened tensions with the United States.During the parade in Pyongyang, Mr. Kim watched from a platform surrounded by elderly military officers as long columns of goose-stepping soldiers marched through a large plaza, accompanied by tanks, missiles and rocket tubes.Saturday was the 105th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the country’s founder, Kim Jong-un’s grandfather and the man the younger Mr. Kim tries to emulate, in looks and action. Kim Il-sung’s birthday, called the Day of the Sun, is the North’s most important holiday and a key moment for scoring propaganda points.The United States, China and other regional powers had feared that North Korea might mark the occasion by conducting its sixth nuclear test or by launching an intercontinental ballistic missile. The United States sent a naval strike group to the coast of the Korean Peninsula in a show of force that has become a first, wary showdown between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump.But no seismic tremor emanated on Saturday morning from the North’s nuclear test site, where recent satellite photographs have shown what appeared to be preparations for an underground detonation.Instead, Mr. Kim seemed to celebrate his grandfather’s birthday with a military parade meant to demonstrate his missile capabilities. He is acutely aware that the threat that he could soon possess — a missile that could strike the continental United States — is Washington’s biggest concern, and both the number and the variety of missiles he showed on Saturday seemed to be sending the message that a pre-emptive strike against his facilities would be fruitless.To military analysts scrutinizing North Korea’s broadcast of the parade, the most noteworthy element seemed to be three types of long-range ballistic missiles, one of them apparently new.While the North has repeatedly claimed that it can strike the United States with a nuclear warhead, it has never flight-tested an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of crossing the Pacific.In addition, some analysts doubt that the country has mastered the skills to build a warhead that can survive re-entry from space, or one small enough to mount on a long-range missile. They said the intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, that had been displayed in recent North Korean military parades might have been mock-ups of systems still under development.In a New Year’s Day speech, however, Mr. Kim claimed that his country was in the “final stage” of preparations for its first ICBM test. Mr. Trump responded with a Twitter message saying that the launching would never be permitted to happen.One missile showed off on Saturday was the KN-08, which the North first displayed in a 2012 parade and is widely believed to have been its first attempt at an intercontinental ballistic missile.Making their parade debut on launcher trucks with huge wheels were very large missiles encased in tubes or canisters. Analysts said the tubes appeared to have been designed for two other kinds of long-range ballistic missiles. There were multiple examples of each tube; it was impossible to see what was in them, but analysts said it was likely that they contained missiles that were either completed or under development.Militaries use such canisters to “cold launch” missiles, ejecting them high into the air before their fuel ignites. If North Korea perfected that technology, it would help the nation better protect its mobile missiles from environmental damage while being driven around and from fiery exhaust during launch. The method can also make missiles harder to detect once fired.“They’re not just showing off missiles that are hard to build,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea specialist at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, in California. “They’re showing off all the associated technologies you need for credible deployments.”Kim Dong-yub, a missile expert at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul, said one kind of tube appeared to be for the KN-14, a modified version of the KN-08 that was first displayed in a parade in 2015, during which the North claimed that its missiles were tipped with nuclear warheads.The other tube design was new to the analysts. “Given the size, it looks like it contains a new ballistic missile with a range of at least 6,000 kilometers,” or 3,700 miles, making it potentially an intercontinental threat, said Shin In-kyun, a military expert who runs the Korea Defense Network, a civic group specializing in military affairs. “Officials in the region will scramble to figure out whether this is a new solid-fuel, long-range ballistic missile the North was believed to be developing.”Almost all of the North’s other ballistic missiles use liquid fuel, which can take hours to load from tanker trucks. Like bottle rockets or Roman candles, solid-fuel missiles carry their own combustible supplies, making them easier to transport and fire. North Korean missiles using the method could be kept on submarines or mobile launching pads, hidden in the country’s elaborate tunnel system and launched on short notice.The Pukguksong-2, an intermediate-range ballistic missile that the North tested in February, uses solid-fuel technology. That missile was displayed in a parade for the first time on Saturday. So were the Pukguksong-1 — the North’s first submarine-launched ballistic missile, which was successfully tested in August — and the Scud-ER, a Scud with an extended range, designed to reach American military bases in South Korea and Japan.North Korea launched four Scud-ERs simultaneously last month, some of them splashing down in waters in Japan’s exclusive economic zone.This year’s parade was watched especially closely in light of the unusual level of regional tension. The United States naval strike group, led by the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, was sent to the area in an attempt to deter North Korea from testing another nuclear device or missile.Aides to Mr. Trump have said they are not ruling out military options in dealing with the North.On Friday, the North Korean military threatened to launch its own pre-emptive nuclear strikes at American military bases in South Korea, Japan and beyond. Warning of “storm clouds gathering,” China, the North’s main ally, urged both sides to exercise restraint.North Korea kept up its defiant statements on Saturday. “If they start a nuclear war, we will respond with nuclear strikes,” Choe Ryong-hae, a senior official in the ruling Workers’ Party and a key aide to Mr. Kim, said in a speech before the parade.One surprise from the parade was the re-emergence of Gen. Kim Won-hong, the former chief of the powerful secret police, the State Security Ministry.South Korea’s National Intelligence Service had said that General Kim was dismissed and demoted in January on charges of corruption and abuse of power. In recent months, he has been absent from state functions, spurring speculation that he might have been purged and sent to a re-education camp.But on Saturday, he was among the generals on the reviewing stand. His uniform bore his four-star insignia, but he appeared to have lost weight.",

Is my friend really queer?: A friend of mine recently came out as queer and I’m not sure how to feel about it. First starters, she has only dated men and is currently married to a man. She is a stay-at-home mother with two kids and wants another one. For all intents and purposes, she lives a very heterosexual lifestyle. I would never accuse someone of lying about her sexuality but I don’t think she’s really queer. She has always been an attention-seeker which is why I think she’s claiming to be queer. Homophobia is very real and I’m afraid people like my friend who pretend to be queer are trivializing real issues faced by gay people. How can I tell her to stop? A: You can’t! You also shouldn’t. Your friend is, presumably, aware that she is married to a man, and that she has children, and even that she would like to have another child. She is likely aware that, married to a man, she faces less daily homophobia than she would if she were married to a woman; she is not attempting to race to the top of Queertimes Mountain and claim the Most Queer Experience for herself. There’s no Sex Quorum for calling yourself queer, no membership requirements. Let’s read her actions with the least generous lens possible and assume you’re correct—that she has somehow fabricated this queer identity and secretly cares only about heterosexualizing all day. That’s still impossible for you to prove, and in no way detracts from anyone else’s ability to care about homophobia. I suggest you take this as an opportunity to not worry about your friend’s sexuality. You are, of course, free to think in the privacy of your own head that she is not “really” queer, but you do not have any grounds to tell her she doesn’t know her own mind or orientation as well as you do. Subscribe to Prudie! Q. Sexual history: I have been in a relationship for several months with a great guy. He’s thoughtful, mature, and accepting. However, he is overly inquisitive about my past sex life. It’s already been established that he’s had more partners than me, and I am not a very sexual person. However, any time we are having a chat about our pasts, while I ask about childhood friends or family time, he always asks about previous partners. I feel like I’ve gone over this with him multiple times now, but somehow his interest always comes back to that. (Other than this, he doesn’t seem to be obsessed with sex, and we have a very balanced relationship.) Is this as weird as I think it is? How can I get him to stop (he knows everything anyway)? I’ve pointed it out to him before but he always takes it as a joke. Advertisement A: It may be that he’s simply used to talking freely about former relationships and sexual encounters with partners, and is still adjusting to your way of discussing your past. Or he may be asking questions in a way that’s pointed, loaded, relentless, and designed to make you feel uncomfortable. You’ve already asked him to back off and he hasn’t taken you seriously, which is not a great sign. The next time you re-visit the issue (and I think you should bring it up soon), tell him, “Hey, I’ve told you as much about my sexual history as I’m comfortable with, but you keep asking about it whenever we discuss our lives before we met one another. I’ve asked you to stop before, but it seems like you take it as a joke, so I wanted to make it clear now that I’m not joking. I’d like you to stop asking me about the other people I’ve slept with. Can you do that?” If he can, great. If he can’t, you have a pretty good sense of how he will act when you try to set other boundaries in the future, and can act accordingly. Q. Lack of trust: My husband has cheated on me in the past and I don’t feel like I can trust him anymore. Despite many arguments and promises, I still catch him lying to me regularly. We have two small kids (toddlers), and I can’t decide whether it’s worse to live with a man I know to be a liar or to be a single mom and never get a break from the kids. I have a hard time not yelling at them already. He is a very involved father and the kids would be devastated. Also, I’m a stay-at-home mom and financially dependent on him. Would my kids be less damaged if I just tough it out until they are 18? I am going to school part-time, but we live in an expensive area and if I leave I will be seriously struggling. A: If your husband is a very involved parent now, it doesn’t necessarily follow that you will never get a break from your children post-divorce, especially if you two share custody. While the negative financial impact of divorce, especially on women, is very real, you would likely qualify for child support from your ex-husband, if not alimony, even if you only had the kids with you half of the time. Consult a divorce lawyer and find out what your financial options would be if you two separated. Consider, in the meantime, the picture you paint of your marriage: You don’t trust your husband, he lies to you regularly, and you’re so overwhelmed with being a full-time parent that you feel on the verge of yelling at your children. This does not sound like a peaceful, respectful environment that benefits your kids, and I imagine they are already pretty aware, even as toddlers, that their parents are not happy together. Since your husband is a great parent but a lousy partner, you two might even find that eventually you have a much happier, healthier relationship as co-parents than you ever did as spouses. You don’t have to file for divorce tomorrow, but visit a good lawyer, start saving whatever you can, and figure out what steps you need to take to prepare for an amicable a divorce as possible. Q. No stone unturned: Recreational marijuana is legal in my state. Being a generally rule-abiding person, I had never tried it before but wanted to once it was legalized. My partner and I talked about it a few times over the span of a couple of months before we finally went to a store and purchased some edibles. We’ve now ingested a couple times, both times with great restraint on the amount because my partner likes to be really careful. I haven’t really felt any effect, but he has. He doesn’t hate it, but he’s not a fan either. If I weren’t in his life he’d probably never bother with marijuana again. The problem is that I want to continue experimenting with it to figure out whether I like it and, if so, to keep doing it because I like it. While this seems like it should be a “my body; my choice” situation, the fact is that my partner is very uncomfortable and/or doesn’t like being around me when he’s sober and I’m not. He’s also uncomfortable with the idea of my doing marijuana without him around. It’s not that he’s not trying to compromise with me, it’s just that he has problems with both of those options. It’s getting to the point where I’m getting annoyed with him. I don’t want to do things that make him uncomfortable. At the same time, while I certainly don’t need to keep trying marijuana, I want to and I feel that it’s within reason for me to make that choice. Are there compromises we aren’t seeing? Is one of us being unreasonable? Advertisement A: This has little to do with your partner’s reluctance, but try smoking or vaping your weed next time; edibles are notoriously difficult to dose out, and ingesting THC is significantly different from smoking it. This might explain why, in your quest to avoid getting too high (a laudable goal) you’ve found yourself not feeling anything at all. If you’d like to try getting high again and he doesn’t want to be around while you do it, that’s absolutely fine, but it’s going one step too far for him to insist you can’t try getting high without him, either. You’re not trying any drugs he’s not comfortable with, and you’re not suggesting you start waking and baking on a daily basis; you just want to get the same amount of high that he did to see what it feels like. He is allowed to feel uncomfortable if you decide to go smoke weed with a friend you trust, and you are allowed to do it anyway, and you both get to talk about your feelings before and afterward.

Q. Re: Is my friend really queer?: There are many queer women that don’t share romantic or sexual experiences they had with other women for fear of being judged, especially if they are also attracted to men. There is a very real chance your friend has dated women and just never told you about it. Also, sexual orientation does not require experience. I imagine most of the straight folks who read this column knew what gender they were attracted to before their first kiss. Advertisement A: This is a useful illustration, I think! There’s also a seeming desire on the part of the original letter writer to litigate what constitutes legitimate vs. illegitimate “attention-seeking” behavior, as if the friend in question is somehow “taking away” attention from the “legitimately” queer, or that said friend’s desire for attention is inherently bad. It is, of course, possible to demand more attention than one is due, or to lie in order to get some, but it’s also true that attention is a pretty basic social need. If someone says “I have information about my sexual orientation that you didn’t previously know, and I want to share it with you and have it affirmed,” that is pretty healthy, normal attention-seeking. It is OK to seek attention sometimes! Q. Do stepchildren need to be invited to a wedding?: I am in my late 50s, as is my wife of one year. We’ve both been married twice before and have children from those marriages. I had a son with my first wife and two daughters with my second wife. My daughters have met my new wife, but my son (who lives overseas) has not. Nor has he met either of my wife’s children, both of whom are adults. My son is getting married later this year. He has invited my wife and I to the wedding but has not invited my wife’s children. She is upset about this as are her two children. They want to attend the wedding and are demanding an invitation. I personally believe they are only interested in attending because the wedding is to take place in France, where my son resides. They were uninterested in the wedding until they learned I was paying for my daughters to attend. Now they want “equal rights” and are demanding I pay for them to attend as well. I am unsure how to proceed. My son isn’t particularly interested in meeting his stepsiblings, who showed no interest in either him or his sisters until the possibility of this trip came up. My wife says that if her children are not welcome at the wedding it is a sign that I am not interested in bonding our families. This is quite true: I am not. Neither of her children has been particularly welcoming to either myself or my children, and their talk about the wedding revolves around how many side trips to Paris or Provence they might be able to take. If this were your situation what would you do? A: You do not have the ability to extend invitations to your son’s wedding on his behalf, and he has declined to invite your wife’s children, who are strangers to him. It is boorish beyond belief for grown adults to demand an invitation (and paid airfare!) to the wedding of someone they’ve never met under the guise of “bonding their families,” which is a fiction so paper-thin it would tear under the slightest pressure. What your wife’s children want is a free vacation to France, and you should not give it to them. You might take them up on their obviously fabricated desire to get to know their new relations by suggesting you all get dinner together sometime after your son returns from his honeymoon. I doubt they will take you up on it. Advertisement Q. Safe or sexy?: I’m a divorced mother in my 40s. I have been dating a wonderful and kind man, who is solid and a great person, with whom I have a connection, but I’m not sure if he’s right for me—he’s a bit boring and not very good sexually. I also have a lover who dominates me in a kinky/SM relationship. We have been together off and on for years to fill a common need. He is married but my match in every other way, intellectually and sexually. Choosing one will necessarily hurt the other, and they are both kind men. What should I do? Choose a safe and loving, if not-quite-right man or an exciting-sexy and stimulating but ultimately unavailable lover? A: Dump them both and find someone who’s available and sexually compatible with you. This is not an either/or situation; there are plenty of unmarried men in the world who would be willing to have kinky sex with you and are capable of holding up their end of a conversation. Q. Repairing mistaken break in friendship: I have had a falling out with a lifelong friend over a complete misunderstanding. I made a completely innocent comment about this friend to a relative who misconstrued it (I believe innocently) and them re-stated it to the friend incorrectly with a more hostile meaning. It’s as if I told the relative, “Friend really smells nice,” and the relative told Friend, “She said you really smell.” This relative has a habit of doing such things, and I honestly believe it’s unintentional. Whatever the intention, my friend got completely upset with me, told me off, refused to listen to or believe my explanations, and has cut off all contact with me. She unfriended me on Facebook and won’t take my calls or texts. I want to respect her right to choose whether or not she has me in her life, but this is a complete comedy of errors and I can’t get over feeling like I ought to be able to get through to her. Should I give up and throw away our friendship or continue persisting? A: I’m a firm believer in the general rule that if someone doesn’t want you to contact them, you don’t contact them, but since you believe this entire estrangement rests upon a misunderstanding, I think it’s worth sending a letter (or email) of explanation. Your friend may throw it away without reading it—at which point it’s worth considering that either something else has been bothering her for a long time and she hasn’t mentioned it, or that she’s willing to end your friendship without a single discussion; either of these possibilities might make you re-evaluate the end of your relationship—but you’ll at least have the satisfaction of knowing you did everything you could to clear things up. After that, if she still doesn’t contact you, I think you should let it lie. You cannot force her to listen to your explanation; all you’ll have is the (relatively) cold consolation of knowing you were right. Advertisement You might consider, too, speaking to your relative with the history of innocent misunderstandings; if nothing else, consider confiding in her less often unless she seems likely to break the habit.

I have made several attempts to set up appointments to get him remove it all, but those days come and go and he doesn’t show up. I asked if they even wanted it because at this point I am ready to take everything to the dump and just be done with it. Not so interested in salvaging any kind of relationship, just don’t want to be a jerk. How do I get my garage back? A: Pick a day 15 or 30 days from now and tell your friend: “I’m having the junk in my garage hauled away to the dump on XXX date; if there’s anything you’d like to keep, come pick it up before then.” Then have it hauled away to the dump with a clear conscience.

Of the eighteen candidates who have entered the race, one has drawn national attention as a kind of mascot for the Trump resistance—Jon Ossoff, a photogenic thirty-year-old Democrat and documentary filmmaker. Ossoff is polling at forty-three per cent and has raised a record $8.3 million, in mostly out-of-state donations. Not surprisingly, this has made him a conservative target. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has run numerous ads and mailers attacking Ossoff. In one recent TV commercial, he is depicted as an ally of hoodie-wearing vandals. An eerie baritone proclaims, over footage of an Inauguration Day riot: “Liberal extremists will stop at nothing to push their radical agenda. . . . Ossoff is one of them.” Yet this is light fare compared with the PAC’s other line of assault. In March, Ossoff filed his financial disclosures with the House, revealing that he had received five thousand dollars from Al Jazeera for “video content development/production.” According to his IMDb page and campaign staff, he worked as a producer on nine episodes of the series “Africa Investigates,” an Al Jazeera English series about undercover journalists who expose “corruption and abuse.” But any association with the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera was automatic grist. A social-media spot* flashed shaky footage of armed Arabs and an image of Osama bin Laden, captioned with large text: “MOUTHPIECE FOR TERRORISTS.” Then, over surveillance-type video of Ossoff, a voice said, “What is he hiding? How can we trust him?” Ominous snail mail followed (“Once you’ve worked for them . . . you can’t work for us”). Ossoff’s campaign manager, Keenan Pontoni, responded with a patriotic defense of the candidate’s journalistic and political career. “Jon served as a national-security aide, had top-secret clearance, and he’s proud of his work as an investigative filmmaker working for outlets all over the world, like the BBC, Sky Vision, and, yes, Al Jazeera,” Pontoni said. It was just four years ago that the network’s U.S. franchise, Al Jazeera America (AJAM), took over Al Gore’s failed cable channel, Current TV. AJAM itself survived less than three years, and though its broadcast and Web coverage was relatively conventional, it never escaped the associations now levelled against Ossoff. The Al Jazeera Media Network is a vast, multilingual operation headquartered in Doha, Qatar. It is owned and funded by the state, but maintains editorial independence. There have been legitimate allegations of bias, particularly when it comes to coverage of the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran, but American hatred of anything Al Jazeera seems to stem less from the company’s editorial slant than from its menacingly foreign-sounding name and the fact that, just a month after 9/11, Al Jazeera aired footage of Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and their armed followers celebrating the merger of their groups. The journalist Sherry Ricchiardi, in a 2011 article for the American Journalism Review, noted that the network’s coverage after the attacks earned it “a reputation as a mouthpiece for terrorists,” particularly within the George W. Bush Administration. It was this assessment that the Congressional Leadership Fund video editors used in their ad against Ossoff. I worked for AJAM from start to finish, and my colleagues and I experienced bias against the outlet every day. One producer told me recently that, in his time there, he grew used to sources ignoring or declining interview requests “because an Arab-American with an Arabic name, writing for an Arab outlet, was talking to them.” A white reporter from the Northeast said that “even people in my own family reacted like I joined a terrorist organization when I told them my new job, in 2013.” And a politics correspondent recalled one source repeatedly asking why she worked for AJAM, what “they” really wanted, and what clandestine Muslim machinations might be at work. I often encountered similar reactions. In 2014, I sought comment from an Alabama legislator on a racial-gerrymandering case before the Supreme Court. I barely got out my name and affiliation before he said, “Al Jazeera America? Get outta here, Roscoe! Not interested. Bye!” and hung up. (I tried, and failed, to figure out what “Roscoe” meant.) The following year, when a daily newspaper in rural Washington State reprinted one of my articles, the publisher received considerable hate mail. “I cannot believe your newspaper is so devoid of news and information that you have to turn to an enemy news source (al Jezeera) for a load of mis-informed crap,” one reader wrote. The local police chief called the staff “traitors” and said that they had “insulted veterans” by using AJAM material. Were AJAM still around, my colleagues and I would likely face renewed hostility, since the network embodied two of the Trump Administration’s favorite scapegoats—foreigners and the media. Next week’s election may show how susceptible voters in Georgia are to such sentiments. The Sixth District, which covers Atlanta and its northern suburbs and resembles a deflated Texas-shaped balloon, is home to seven hundred thousand people. The population is relatively affluent and mostly white, but it is changing rapidly, with significant African-American, Latino, and Asian minorities. A full twenty-one per cent of the district’s residents were born outside the United States. That’s perhaps why this once solidly Republican district, represented by Newt Gingrich from 1979 to 1999, has lately turned purple and is verging on blue. Still, Ossoff himself, despite being white and a native of the Sixth District, has faced accusations of foreignness. Last month, Jere Wood, the Republican mayor of Roswell, a city just north of Atlanta, questioned whether Ossoff’s “ethnic-sounding name” would hold local appeal. “If someone is going down the list, they’re gonna vote for somebody who is familiar,” Wood told my colleague Charles Bethea. “If you just say ‘Ossoff,’ some folks are gonna think, ‘Is he Muslim? Is he Lebanese? Is he Indian?’ ” Wood later explained to the Atlanta NBC affiliate that he’d meant something else entirely. “Barack Obama showed us that a name can be an advantage,” he said. *An earlier version of this post misstated the medium through which the Web video was distributed.",

      "text" : "A portfolio of Southern cases, genteel courtroom traditions and years of forceful conservative rulings shape the enduring image of the federal appeals court in Richmond. But the bench has shed its conservative label, undergoing a sea change in the past decade, and is poised to have an immediate impact on the fledgling Trump administration. Starting next month, the full court will take up the president’s entry ban for immigrants from some countries, followed by the case of a transgender teen whose battle to use a boy’s bathroom challenges the president’s new policy. Since taking office, President Trump has harshly criticized federal judges, specifically deriding the San Francisco-based appeals court — which put the first version of his travel ban on hold — as in “chaos” and “turmoil.” Yet the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, a Richmond-based venue the administration might once have found reliably hospitable, now has a higher proportion of judges tapped by Democrats than most of the nation’s 13 circuit courts. That includes the pan-Western 9th Circuit with its long-standing reputation among conservatives as the “nutty 9th.” Roger Gregory, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, is interviewed in 2016 in his office in Richmond. (Steve Helber/Associated Press) A test of how far the 4th Circuit bench has tilted left will come May 8. The court announced this week that it would bypass the traditional three-judge panel and gather that day as a full complement en banc to review Trump’s entry ban. Already within the past year, judges at the historic Italianate courthouse, who descend from the bench to shake hands with the attorneys who have argued before them, have issued major opinions that would have been unimaginable two decades ago. The court said Republican lawmakers in North Carolina deliberately undercut the political power of African American voters through targeted voting restrictions. Judges sided with the Virginia transgender teen in the first round of his fight. And in a gun decision that went further than other appeals courts, the Richmond-based circuit ruled that the Second Amendment does not protect what it called “weapons of war” in a case trying to undo a Maryland ban on semiautomatic, military-style firearms. “There’s a persistent impression that’s long been out of date that this is a very conservative court,” said Steven Goldblatt, who directs the appellate litigation program at Georgetown University’s law school and regularly appears before the court. “It’s a different court with many new judges who cannot be measured by decisions reached many years ago.” [Second federal judge blocks revised Trump travel ban] The court’s caseload consists of appeals from Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the Carolinas. After federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked critical sections of the president’s revised travel order in March, the Justice Department appealed. The administration also asked the 4th Circuit to put the Maryland judge’s opinion on hold and allow the ban to take effect immediately ahead of oral arguments next month. The Maryland case applies only to the provision of Trump’s order that would have stopped new visas for travelers from six Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

(U.S. General Services Administration) The court also has been asked to rule again in the case of Gavin Grimm, the transgender teen challenging his school’s requirement that students use a bathroom that corresponds to their “biological sex.” The case returned to Richmond after the Supreme Court decided in March to put off a ruling on transgender rights and referred it back to the 4th Circuit to possibly look at broader constitutional questions. When it ruled in Grimm’s favor initially, the 4th Circuit cited the Obama administration’s position on transgender student rights. The Trump administration since has revoked federal guidelines that directed schools to allow transgender students to use a bathroom consistent with their gender identity. Last week, Senior Judge Andre M. Davis and Judge Henry F. Floyd — both nominated by President Barack Obama — took the unusual step of issuing a passionate statement placing Grimm among the pantheon of human rights leaders who confronted inequities through the courts. Grimm’s case will likely be heard in September. [Supreme Court sends transgender case back to lower court] For years, attorneys pursuing liberal-leaning policies viewed the 4th Circuit as hostile territory for civil rights and for criminal defendants, and as a reliable backstop on national security policies. But that is changing. Several national legal organizations that have the flexibility to choose where to wage their legal battles are deliberately turning to the 4th Circuit. The national groups that filed the most recent challenge to Trump’s entry ban in Maryland — the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union — could have gone to other venues. “The court has become a much friendlier forum in civil rights cases, and it appears that criminal defendants have found a more open ear,” said Charlotte attorney Jake Sussman, who has defended inmates on death row and successfully challenged North Carolina’s ban on same-sex marriage. The 15-judge court looks very different today than it did two decades ago. In 1993, the bench included only one woman and no minorities. Three-quarters of the judges were nominated by Republican presidents, including leading conservative voices — J. Michael Luttig and J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who in later years both were on George W. Bush’s short list for the Supreme Court. In the late 1990s, the court issued opinions upholding restrictions on abortions and striking down a law allowing rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court. The court in 1999 overturned the requirement that police read suspects their rights, known as Miranda rights, before interrogating them. The Supreme Court later reaffirmed Miranda rights. On national security matters, the court often upheld the post-9/11 policies of the Bush administration, supporting the detention of enemy combatants. In death penalty cases, the Supreme Court reversed a number of 4th Circuit rulings in the early 2000s, leading to a measure of relief for inmates on death row. Conservatives were stunned in 2006 when Luttig announced his retirement to become general counsel for Boeing. At the time Obama took office, the split on the court still favored Republican nominees, 6 to 5. But with four vacancies, the administration saw an opportunity to remake the court — as it did on other circuit courts — and diversify the bench to better reflect the demographics of the country. Rakesh Kilaru, who worked in the White House counsel’s office during Obama’s tenure, clerked for Wilkinson in 2010, the year that three new judges joined the court. “The picture I have that is signed by all of the judges looks quite different than the picture you would have seen a few years before, and I think that’s something the president is quite proud of,” Kilaru said, referring to Obama. Among the 15 active judges on the court, there are five women, of whom one is African American, one Latino judge and two African American men, including Roger Gregory, the chief judge. Gregory was initially appointed by President Bill Clinton during a congressional recess and later was nominated by Bush at the urging of Virginia’s two senators. Judge Diana Gribbon Motz, a Clinton nominee, was for years on the losing side, particularly on national security cases. Motz wrote the recent opinion striking down North Carolina’s voting restrictions that she said “target African Americans with almost surgical precision.” The court now has a handful of Obama nominees on the bench to the left of her. A total of 10 of the active judges were nominated by Democrats. That leaves the 4th Circuit — along with three other circuits — with 67 percent of judges nominated by Democrats, ranking at the top with the Boston-based 1st Circuit, the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit and the Federal Circuit in Washington, according to an analysis by Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominations at the Brookings Institution. Wheeler cautioned that there is a spectrum of views and approaches even among judges nominated by the same president, but that the party of the president who chose a judge is not a bad predictor of a judge’s perspective.

Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Cases are argued before randomly assigned panels, and it is still possible to draw a panel of three judges all nominated by Republican presidents. But the odds have shifted, and, when the court agrees to a redo and reviews a case en banc, the balance tips decidedly left. In March, a full panel convened to revisit a 2-to-1 decision in favor of North Carolina county commissioners sued by the ACLU for opening their meetings with mostly Christian prayers. The court did not explain its highly unusual decision this week to skip the three-judge panel in the challenge to Trump’s revised entry ban. But the move initiated by the court suggests the judges recognize the need to move quickly on a contentious issue with national significance that appears destined to end up at the Supreme Court. Allison Orr Larsen, a William and Mary Law School professor who also clerked for Wilkinson, said the court may have lost its conservative label but not its sense of collegiality. “Even for those difficult, politically charged cases, I’m sure they will be thoughtfully deliberated by everyone regardless of the political affiliation,” she said. The court, she added, “puts a premium on collaboration.” Read more: Judges hail transgender teen Gavin Grimm as human rights leader Hateful acts may be rising but will court cases follow?

      "text" : "All at once, Bill O’Reilly is fighting for his TV life. The future of O’Reilly’s long career at Fox News may hinge on a sexual-harassment accusation raised by a woman named Wendy Walsh, who has alleged that O’Reilly propositioned her in a Los Angeles hotel in 2013, then retaliated against her when she rebuffed him. Walsh, a Los Angeles radio personality and author who offers relationship advice, hasn’t sued or sought compensation — just validation that she and other women were wronged by the blunt-spoken host of “The O’Reilly Factor.” Her accusation came on top of the disclosure earlier this month that O’Reilly and Fox News have settled five harassment allegations since 2002, paying $13 million to former network employees for their silence. Yet Walsh’s allegation is potentially the most explosive of all: Fox News was apparently unaware of it until she raised it for the first time in an interview with the New York Times this month. Her complaint has triggered an investigation at Fox by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the same firm that uncovered widespread harassment allegations against Fox News chairman Roger Ailes last summer, leading to his ouster. A similar fate could await O’Reilly; a negative finding by the law firm could force the hands of Fox News Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, who run Fox’s parent company. In view of the stakes involved, O’Reilly’s camp is vigorously contesting Walsh’s allegation, in an unusually public way. His advocates have challenged details of her story, as well as some of the media reporting about it. O’Reilly himself has remained silent; he started an abrupt two-week vacation last week amid a steady exodus of advertisers from his program. The originator of the “No-Spin Zone” has instead left his public defense to a well-known spin doctor, Mark Fabiani, a former spokesman for president Bill Clinton. What's the end game for Bill O'Reilly, Fox News?

(Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post) According to Walsh, 54, O’Reilly dropped her as a regular guest on his show and reneged on a promise to help her secure a paying position as a Fox News commentator after she turned down his invitation to visit his hotel suite during a dinner meeting in Los Angeles in February 2013. However, O’Reilly’s defenders say O’Reilly never made a job offer and did not retaliate against her. Instead, they say, O’Reilly was continuously helpful to Walsh after their meeting at the Hotel Bel-Air. O’Reilly, for example, continued to invite her on his program for four months after the hotel encounter. During several of her appearances, which focused on relationships and behaviorial issues, O’Reilly plugged Walsh’s book, “The 30-Day Love Detox,” a valuable bit of promotion, given O’Reilly’s large audience. But Lisa Bloom, Walsh’s attorney, said Walsh continued to go on O’Reilly’s program because she hoped to become a paid contributor to Fox News. Bloom called the Fox News host “a mean-spirited bully” who put Walsh in a “no-win situation” when he allegedly asked her to go to his hotel room. O’Reilly, she said, has “a history of attacking women who complain about his sexual harassment.” As for O’Reilly’s help in promoting Walsh’s book, Bloom said, “Life is not black or white. Wendy does not contend that every action he took was retaliation. . . . She [was] trying to stay very friendly with him to salvage that chance for the job. She wanted him to see her as nonthreatening. She wanted him to be professional and get over it.” Walsh was a guest on “The Factor” 13 times after her meeting with O’Reilly in Los Angeles, appearing almost weekly from late February until mid-June of that year. He mentioned her book four times after it was published in mid-April and repeatedly showed its cover on the air. O’Reilly also was apparently instrumental in securing for Walsh an appearance on the daytime chat program “The View” in mid-April during which she also promoted her book. That year, Walsh wrote to one of O’Reilly’s producers in mid-April, asking him for further promotional help. “Please, please, pretty please, can we do a segment on my book on the 25th???,” she wrote in an email, proposing several potential ideas for discussion. O’Reilly didn’t take up her suggestions, but Walsh did travel from Los Angeles to New York to appear on the Fox News set with him for her regular segment that day. Another email is from Walsh to O’Reilly’s assistant in September 2013, seven months after the hotel meeting. “Specifically, please convey to ‘the boss’ [O’Reilly] that I am deeply grateful for his professional kindness,” Walsh wrote. “His media power is immeasurable and his call to [“The View’s” executive producer] really launched my book tour on a high note. Can’t thank him enough.” Bloom did not dispute the emails’ authenticity. According to both sides, the program’s producers told Walsh in mid-June that her regular weekly segments — titled “Are We Crazy?” — would be ending. Walsh was identified as a “human behavior expert” on the segments, which covered such topics as online dating, helicopter parenting and declining moral values. There’s some dispute about exactly when her appearances would end. Bloom contends that Walsh was told that her segment would be suspended during the summer vacation period and that there was a chance it could return in the fall. But Bonny Forrest, a psychologist and lawyer who appeared with Walsh each week, said it was clear in June that she and Walsh were finished. Forrest said Walsh made no mention of the hotel episode or of retaliation by O’Reilly when they spoke about the potential demise of their segments that June. In an interview, Forrest said Walsh first raised the hotel episode with her in vague terms in September 2013, when it was clear to Walsh that Fox did not intend to bring them back on the air. Forrest said Walsh told her then that she suspected their cancellation was due to the hotel encounter. But Walsh didn’t mention then that O’Reilly had offered and then rescinded a job, Forrest said. “I heard the allegation from her in September, and what she related to me was very different from what’s in the press now,” Forrest said. lifestyle style true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Forrest — who has been interviewed by investigators representing Paul Weiss — added: “I take sexual harassment and racial discrimination very seriously. But I also believe in this instance there are some statements made in press that aren’t consistent with my experience.” According to Bloom, Walsh told a number of friends about O’Reilly’s alleged behavior since 2013. She declined to come forward last summer when Paul Weiss was investigating sexual-harassment complaints at Fox News on the assumption that the inquiry was focused on Ailes, not O’Reilly. Her first formal mention of it to anyone at Fox News came last week, when she and Bloom made a formal complaint to a company hotline set up for harassment complaints. When a New York Times reporter called Walsh late last year, she was reluctant to go on the record, but ultimately decided to speak up, Bloom said. “She was scared,” she said. “But she knew that we can never change the epidemic of sexual harassment unless we speak out.” O’Reilly has never admitted to sexual harassment. He said he settled the complaints against him to spare his children from negative publicity about himself. Walsh decided to come forward out of concern for her children, too, Bloom said: “She did it for her daughters.”",

      "text" : "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has asked the White House to lift Obama-era restrictions on U.S. military support for Persian Gulf states engaged in a protracted civil war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, according to senior Trump administration officials. In a memo this month to national security adviser H.R. ­McMaster, Mattis said that “limited support” for Yemen operations being conducted by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — including a planned Emirati offensive to retake a key Red Sea port — would help combat a “common threat.” Approval of the request would mark a significant policy shift. U.S. military activity in Yemen until now has been confined mainly to counterterrorism operations against al-Qaeda’s affiliate there, with limited indirect backing for gulf state efforts in a two-year-old war that has yielded significant civilian casualties. It would also be a clear signal of the administration’s intention to move more aggressively against Iran. The Trump White House, in far stronger terms than its predecessor, has echoed Saudi and Emirati charges that Iran is training, arming and directing the Shiite Houthis in a proxy war to increase its regional clout against the Gulf’s Sunni monarchies. The administration is in the midst of a larger review of overall Yemen policy that is not expected to be completed until next month. But the immediate question, addressed by Mattis’s memo and tentatively slated to come before the principals committee of senior national security aides this week, is whether to provide support for a proposed UAE-led operation to push the Houthis from the port of Hodeida, through which humanitarian aid and rebel supplies pass. The Pentagon memo does not recommend agreeing to every element of the Emirati request. A proposal to provide American Special Operations forces on the ground on the Red Sea coast “was not part of the request [Mattis] is making,” said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss planning and the review. This official and several others said that Mattis and his advisers have asked for removal of President Barack Obama’s prohibitions, which would enable the military to support Emirati operations against the Houthis with surveillance and intelligence, refueling, and operational planning assistance without asking for case-by-case White House approval. A similar Emirati proposal for help in attacking Hodeida was rejected late last year by the Obama administration, on the grounds that Emirati ships and warplanes, U.S. Special Operations forces and Yemeni government troops were unlikely to succeed in dislodging the entrenched, well-armed rebels and could worsen the humanitarian situation. The effort was seen as sure to escalate a war that the United States and the United Nations have been trying to stop. [Hundreds of thousands of Yemeni children are nearing starvation] Some advisers to President Trump share those same concerns, the senior official said. “There has been no decision yet as to whether [the restrictions] will be lifted. There is certainly broad disagreement across our government.” While acknowledging that some might see ending the limits as “a green light for direct involvement in a major war. . . . We can’t judge yet what the [review] results will be,” the official said, adding that the limits could be modified, removed or left in place. A Yemeni man walks past graffiti protesting U.S. drone operations. (Yahya Arhab/European Pressphoto Agency) Advisers are considering whether direct support for the anti-Houthi coalition would take too many resources away from the counterterrorism fight against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and a nascent Islamic State organization in Yemen, the U.S. priority there. At the same time, what is described as a bare-bones UAE plan has given rise to worry that the Emiratis may not be capable of such a large operation, including holding and stabilizing any reclaimed area, without sucking in U.S. forces. Without knowing whether the Houthis will give in or fight back — including with Iranian-supplied missiles — there is also concern among U.S. officials that the offensive would further undermine stalemated efforts to negotiate an end to the war and make an already dire humanitarian situation worse. Yemen’s population centers have been decimated by the conflict, in which indiscriminate Saudi airstrikes and fighting on the ground have killed an estimated 10,000 civilians. Both the Houthis, who hold the capital, Sanaa, Hodeida and other cities, and Saudi Arabia, which controls the sea perimeter around Hodeida, have restricted delivery of aid and other goods flowing through the port to other population centers. On Wednesday, U.N. humanitarian officials said that millions of Yemenis were on the verge of starvation. Yves Daccord, director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, warned that an extended battle for the port city would “put even more pressure on the population” and could tip the country into greater humanitarian crisis. While the warring parties have taken part in U.N.-brokered peace talks, negotiations are stalled and all parties remain in practice most interested in battlefield victory, Daccord said in an interview. “That’s the problem in Yemen,” he said. “They all still think they can win militarily.” Gulf nations see Hodeida as a vital asset for the Houthis and a lifeline to their backers in Iran. A plan developed by the U.S. Central Command to assist the operation includes other elements that are not part of Mattis’s request, officials said. While Marine Corps ships have been off the coast of Yemen for about a year, it was not clear what support role they might play. The Obama administration’s reluctance to take part in the Yemen war was part of Trump’s campaign indictment of his predecessor as “weak” on dealing with Iran, and it led to tensions between the United States and Persian Gulf states. Obama provided limited support for the Saudi and Emirati operations, selling them weapons and refueling their aircraft. But dismay over reports of Saudi pilots’ repeated strikes on hospitals, schools and other soft targets prompted his administration to distance itself from the Houthi campaign and impose restrictions. Administration lawyers also raised concerns about U.S. legal responsibility for acts committed by the Saudi-led gulf coalition. [Trump administration looks to resume Saudi arms sale criticized as endangering civilians in Yemen] Late last year, in response to a particularly gruesome strike, the Obama administration further scaled back support to the air campaign and froze the sale of certain munitions to Riyadh. For their part, gulf leaders complained that Obama was pushing them to wrap up the war quickly while withholding support they saw as crucial to pushing the Houthis to the negotiating table. Trump shares the Sunni gulf states’ antipathy for Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, along with their belief that Tehran is the principal driver in the Yemen war, and he has signaled a new approach. In a statement last month condemning Iranian ballistic missile tests, Michael Flynn, then Trump’s national security adviser, spoke at length about the Iran-Houthi threat and said the administration was “putting Iran on notice.” A senior administration official said at the time that “we assess Iran seeks to leverage this relationship with the Houthis to build a long-term presence in Yemen” and that “we are going to take appropriate action. We are considering a whole range of options.” Early this month, the State Department approved a resumption of sales of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. A White House spokesman would not comment on whether Trump had signed off on the sales, saying only that the requisite congressional notification had not yet been made. For the administration, the response to the Emirati proposal is partly rooted in a desire to act against a troubling threat off Yemen’s western coast, where officials say Houthi missile attacks have endangered freedom of navigation in a key commercial waterway. The Bab el-Mandeb Strait provides a narrow entry into the Red Sea between the Arabian Peninsula and the African continent. In a rare direct attack on Houthi interests, the United States in October struck Houthi-controlled coastal radar sites with Tomahawk cruise missiles, in retaliation for an assault on U.S. and allied ships. One of the Houthi missiles launched at the USS Mason, a guided-missile destroyer, was fired from Hodeida, officials said at the time. Restrictions on some intelligence-sharing have already been lifted, allowing the United States to reveal more detailed information on the location of Houthi missile sites. The United States is expected to take other steps to counter that threat, including positioning additional ships in the area. Some former officials believe stepped-up action is overdue. “One of our bedrock interests in the Middle East is freedom of navigation in and around the Arabian Peninsula, and while I understand why no one wanted to get further enmeshed in the Houthi conflict, we came dangerously close to dropping the ball on protecting our interests toward the end of the administration,” said Andrew Exum, who was a senior Pentagon official under Obama. “We were too hesitant to respond forcefully.” [U.S. plan to help Yemenis obtain humanitarian aid falters] With Trump’s selection of Mattis to lead the Pentagon and other Iran hawks at the White House, gulf officials see an opportunity to act jointly against their regional rival. Saudi Maj. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a spokesman for the gulf coalition, said in a phone interview that “at least now we understand that the government of the United States sees the reality on the ground . . . and that there is a country in the area that wants to use militias and spoil the situation.” “Now the U.S., Saudis and the UAE are back on the same page,” said Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to Washington. “We’re getting the support we need.” Full consideration of Mattis’s proposal, and the overall Yemen review, have been delayed by other national security issues, including a major meeting last week in Washington of the 68-member U.S. coalition against the Islamic State. But if decisions are not made soon, the senior administration official said, “we’re afraid the situation” in Yemen may escalate, “and our partners may take action regardless. And we won’t have visibility, and we won’t be in a position to understand what it does to our counterterrorism operations.” Regional experts expressed varying opinions about U.S. support for the Hodeida operation, world national-security Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Checkpoint newsletter Military, defense and security at home and abroad.

      "text" : "Dave Chappelle: From 'The Nutty Professor' to ‘Chappelle's Show’ and finally, Netflix Embed Copy Share Play Video3:02 Netflix released two new Dave Chappelle stand-up specials on March 21. His last special was released in 2004. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) Netflix released two new Dave Chappelle stand-up specials on March 21. His last special was released in 2004. Netflix is releasing two new Dave Chappelle stand-up specials on March 21. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) Dave Chappelle hasn’t been gone from comedy — but he’s been elusive. We’re talking little to no social media. Rarely giving interviews. Living in a small Ohio town whose residents are highly protective of their most famous neighbor. Banning cellphones at stand-up shows, meaning no grainy footage of jokes-in-progress. The only way to experience Chappelle’s comedy was actually to experience it live, in-the-moment and in that moment alone. Imagine that. That is, until this week. While Chappelle hosted “Saturday Night Live” in November, the highly-anticipated release of his two Netflix specials marks his full-fledged re-entry into the spotlight as fans across the globe get to instantly watch and re-watch two hours of material. This is his biggest splash since 2005, when he left his Comedy Central series — and the $50 million deal attached to it. He was arguably comedy’s biggest name at the time, but he no longer felt “Chappelle’s Show” was socially responsible, and he walked away at the pinnacle of his career. All those experiences make for unique perspectives on celebrity, politics and associated moral dilemmas, themes he began exploring in his last special, 2004’s “For What It’s Worth,” and on display even more in the new specials, 2015’s “Deep in the Heart of Texas” and 2016’s “The Age of Spin.” At a time when entertainers come under fire for years-old tweets, we see Chappelle utterly at ease and unapologetic — the result of working for three decades as a comic and grappling with dizzying fame. [Dave Chappelle has always joked about policing. Here’s how he tackles it in his Netflix specials.] Dave Chappelle performs to a sold out crowd onstage at the Hollywood Palladium on March 25, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. More than a decade after walking away from Comedy Central, Chappelle inked a $60 million deal with Netflix to release a trio of specials, the third of which will be recorded this year. Chappelle’s latest musings come as the comedy landscape is much more crowded, as technology has flattened the bar-to-entry with endless platforms. Entertainment, like nearly every aspect of American public life, has become intensely politicized. Celebrity culture has taken on new dimensions — we now have a president whose path to the White House was paved by reality TV, who uses the same language to criticize political adversaries as he does Meryl Streep. The comedian structures “The Age of Spin” around four encounters with another celebrity who’s reemerged in pop-culture, O.J. Simpson, starting when Chappelle was a relatively unknown 18-year-old comic receiving encouragement from “The Juice,” and ending just after he left Comedy Central, when Simpson was a washed-up pariah. Chappelle closes out the special with a complex attempt to reconcile with the positive legacy of a personal hero — Bill Cosby — and the heinous crimes he’s been accused of committing. Chappelle also addresses the gossip that’s followed him, including the TMZ reports that he was booed off a Detroit stage. He was booed, sure, but he stayed. Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock appear backstage at the Oscars in 2016. (Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) His new material shows ways celebrity has changed him. He jokes about being pulled over by the cops in Los Angeles. “The friend that was driving me was black, which doesn’t really have anything to do with the story other than to let you know that there was fear in the car,” Chappelle quips. “Not my fear. I’m black. But I’m also Dave Chappelle.” [Dave Chappelle on SNL shows how much America could have used him this election cycle] He’s had plenty of time to reflect on what happens when you become uber-famous. “Fame is a horrifying concept when it’s aimed at you,” Chappelle told CBS’s Gayle King this week. “You see people project all these different things onto you — some good, some not so good. Fame is not a very trustworthy idea. I feel like they blow you up as a balloon animal and at the end of the day, you don’t have that much control over it.” He’s clearly not putting out new material to boost his star power. “I mean, I go to the same Starbucks every day, and last week, they ask me for pictures,” he told King. “The perception of you changes because they saw you on that thing, which is fine. I just don’t want to go too far in that realm.” In the new specials, Chappelle gets into his Kevin Hart envy, petty anger he takes out on the homeless and why he blew off a Flint fundraiser to go to the Oscars. “What am I gonna do about that water?” he asks. “I’m not a superhero.” lifestyle style-blog true Today's Headlines newsletter The day's most important stories. Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Far from it. In “The Age of Spin,” along with “Deep in the Heart of Texas” — which feels more like a comedy club act than a polished, theater performance — Chappelle comes off as not giving a damn whether you like him or not. Plenty of people won’t. His jokes about the LGBT community and in particular transgender folks have already disappointed some fans who find the material offensive, out-of-touch and/or just plainly not funny. During a secret show Monday in Los Angeles, Chappelle indicated that he knew that reaction was coming. As the Los Angeles Times wrote, Chappelle said that those jokes were “not malicious” but may upset some. “None of that exchange is printable here, and yes, it was quite brazen in its lack of political correctness,” the newspaper described. Like any comic, Chappelle has every right to tell the joke he wants to tell. And audiences have every right to hate it. That’s the beauty of stand-up comedy, and something Chappelle couldn’t get from his wildly-popular sketch comedy show: He both bears responsibility over the material and has total control over it. Stand-up allows him to return to the spotlight on his own terms. As Chappelle told CBS’s King, “I’m nervous about being on the big stage again, but the special is done. You put something out, and people are, ‘You’re great! You’re terrible!’ I don’t care about that kind of stuff.” Why should he? He’s Dave Chappelle, remember?",

      "text" : "Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state and the chairwoman of the Fulton County, Ga., Board of Commissioners, was the second-highest vote-getter in Tuesday’s special election, according to The Associated Press, to fill the House seat in suburban Atlanta vacated by Tom Price, the health and human services secretary.By capturing 19.8 percent of the vote, the most among the 11 Republicans who were on the ballot, Ms. Handel secured a place in the June runoff against Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who led the entire field with 48.1 percent.■ Ms. Handel, 55, was first elected to help lead the municipal government in Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia, in 2003, and she was elected secretary of state in 2006, overseeing the state’s elections. She ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for governor in 2010 and the United States Senate in 2014. This political ubiquity prompted attacks from her Republican opponents that accused her of being a career politician. But her frequent appearances on ballots in the Sixth District, in the fast-growing Atlanta suburbs, gave her a crucial name-identification advantage in this race.■ Ms. Handel was the Republican front-runner from the moment she entered the race. She was swiftly targeted for criticism, both directly and indirectly, by many of her Republican rivals and their supporters. The most memorable commercial aired against her came from Dan Moody, a former state senator, who portrayed Ms. Handel, who often wears a pearl necklace, as a lumbering elephant in a huge set of pearls.■ She balanced the Fulton County budget when she led the Board of Commissioners, and as secretary of state, put a voter ID law into effect, accomplishments she trumpeted on the campaign trail leading up to the first vote. But Ms. Handel also was criticized by supporters of her Republican rivals for increasing spending on her office budget as chairwoman of the county commission, attacks likely to be reprised by Democrats in the runoff.■ Ms. Handel gained national attention in 2012 when she was a senior official at the Susan G. Komen Foundation, a breast-cancer charity. With Ms. Handel serving as a senior vice president for policy, the foundation announced its intent to cut funding for screenings with Planned Parenthood, the women’s health care and abortion provider. An uproar ensued, and Ms. Handel, who opposes abortion rights, quickly resigned from the group. The foundation swiftly restored Planned Parenthood’s eligibility for grants.■ Though she has become well known in Georgia political circles, Ms. Handel grew up in modest circumstances in the Maryland suburbs of Washington. She moved to the Atlanta area in the 1990s when her husband got a job there, and she went on to hold a number of posts in the private sector and in government before turning to elected office. But she has not shed her allegiance to a onetime Maryland institution: Ms. Handel still cheers for the National Football League’s Colts, now of Indianapolis.",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — All the elements of the North Korean nuclear crisis — the relentless drive by Kim Jong-un to assemble an arsenal, the propaganda and deception swirling around his progress, the hints of a covert war by the United States to undermine the effort, rather than be forced into open confrontation — were on vivid display this weekend.There was the parade in Pyongyang’s main square, with wave after wave of missiles atop mobile launchers, intended to convey a sense that Mr. Kim’s program is unstoppable. Then came another embarrassing setback, a missile test that failed seconds after liftoff, the same pattern seen in a surprising number of launches since President Barack Obama ordered stepped-up cyber- and electronic-warfare attacks in early 2014. Finally, there was the test that did not happen, at least yet — a sixth nuclear explosion. It is primed and ready to go, satellite images show.What is playing out, said Robert Litwak of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who tracks this potentially deadly interplay, is “the Cuban missile crisis in slow motion.” But the slow-motion part appears to be speeding up, as President Drumpf and his aides have made it clear that the United States will no longer tolerate the incremental advances that have moved Mr. Kim so close to his goals.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has said repeatedly that “our policy of strategic patience has ended,” hardening the American position as Mr. Kim makes steady progress toward two primary goals: shrinking a nuclear weapon to a size that can fit atop a long-range missile, and developing a hydrogen bomb, with up to a thousand times the power than the Hiroshima-style weapons he has built so far.While all historical analogies are necessarily imprecise — for starters, President John F. Kennedy dealt with the Soviets and Fidel Castro in a perilous 13 days in 1962, while the roots of the Korean crisis go back a quarter-century — one parallel shines through. When national ambitions, personal ego and deadly weapons are all in the mix, the opportunities for miscalculation are many.So far, Mr. Drumpf has played his hand — militarily, at least — as cautiously as his predecessors: A series of Situation Room meetings has come to the predictable conclusion that while the United States can be more aggressive, it should stop just short of confronting the North so frontally that it risks rekindling the Korean War, nearly 64 years after it came to an uneasy armistice.Still, the current standoff has grown only more volatile. It pits a new president’s vow never to allow North Korea to put American cities at risk — “It won’t happen!” he said on Twitter on Jan. 2 — against a young, insecure North Korean leader who sees that capability as his only guarantee of survival.Mr. Drumpf is clearly new to this kind of dynamic, as he implicitly acknowledged when he volunteered that Xi Jinping, China’s president, had given him what amounted to a compressed seminar in Chinese-North Korean relations. He emerged surprised that Beijing did not have the kind of absolute control over its impoverished neighbor that he insisted it did last year.“After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,” he said. “It’s not what you would think.”Mr. Drumpf’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, gave voice to the difficult balancing act on North Korea on Sunday. General McMaster, himself a military historian, said on ABC’s “This Week” that while the president had not ruled out any option, it was time for the United States “to take action, short of armed conflict, so we can avoid the worst” in dealing with “this unpredictable regime.” Translation: Pre-emptive strikes are off the table, at least for now.The fact that Mr. Kim did not conduct a nuclear test over the weekend, timed to the anniversary of the birth of his grandfather, the founder of the country and its nuclear program, may indicate that Mr. Xi has given him pause. In the White House’s telling, Mr. Xi is responding to pressure by Mr. Drumpf to threaten a cutoff of the North’s financial links and energy supplies — its twin lifelines as a state.“Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem?” Mr. Drumpf asked in a Twitter post on Sunday morning, making it clear that everything, including the trade issues he vowed to solve as a candidate, could be a bargaining chip when it comes to defanging the North.The North is trying to create the sense that it is too late for any such defanging — that it has reached a tipping point in its nuclear push. That is why Mr. Kim stood for hours as so many missiles rolled by on Saturday, carried on portable launch vehicles that can be hidden in hundreds of tunnels bored into North Korean mountains.For all the talk of an eventual intercontinental missile that can reach the United States, one of the stars of the show was a missile of lesser range — the Pukguksong-2, also known as the KN-15. It is a solid-fuel rocket that can be launched in minutes, unlike liquid-fueled missiles, which take hours of preparation. That means they are far less vulnerable to a pre-emptive strike from an American missile launched from a base in Japan or from a carrier strike group like the one Mr. Drumpf has put off the Korean coast.The KN-15 was successfully tested in February. On Saturday, it was paraded in public for the first time, like a conquering hero fresh from a moon landing.“The big takeaway is that they’re taking this seriously,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea specialist at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies at Monterey, in California. “They’re trying to develop operational systems that might actually survive on the ground,” perhaps even enduring blows meant to leave them crippled or destroyed.But Mr. Kim’s otherwise triumphant day took a bad turn when the missile test failed. North Korea used to be pretty successful at launching missiles, so much so that its missiles were sold around the world. Then its launches started failing, suggesting the presence of a hidden Washington hand.Its big setbacks have revolved around the most threatening missile it has so far flight-tested, known as the Musudan. Last year, it had a failure rate of 88 percent. Mr. Kim was reported to have ordered an investigation into the possibility of foreign sabotage, and the missile has remained unseen since.Asked on Fox News on Sunday whether the United States had played any role in the latest missile failure, K. T. McFarland, General McMaster’s departing deputy, said, “You know we can’t talk about that.” Most likely, no one knows for sure, but the ambiguity feeds North Korea’s paranoia, intelligence experts say.But such programs buy time; they are not solutions. Equally worrisome to Washington officials and private analysts is the North’s steady progress over a decade in developing nuclear warheads that are small enough to fit atop long-range missiles. By definition, the atomic work appears to be far less open to prying eyes and foreign sabotage. The explosive nuclear tests take place in tunnels dug deep beneath a rugged mountain.“They’ve done five tests in 10 years,” said Siegfried S. Hecker, a Stanford professor who once directed the Los Alamos weapons laboratory in New Mexico, a birthplace of the atomic bomb. “You can learn a lot in that time.”Tempting as the analogies to Cuba may be, Mr. Kim is probably thinking of another nuclear negotiation — with Libya, in 2003. Its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, agreed to give up his nascent nuclear program in return for promises from the West of economic integration and acceptance. It never really happened, and as soon as Libya’s populace turned against the dictator during the Arab Spring, the United States and its European and Arab allies drove him from power. Ultimately, he was pulled out of a ditch and shot.Periodically, the North Koreans write about that experience, noting what a sap Colonel Qaddafi was to give up the nuclear program that might have saved him. Mr. Kim, it appears, is not planning to make the same mistake.",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-populists-vs-establishment-the-establishment-strikes-back-1490629805Is it possible the populist tide is cresting?It’s too early to draw any definitive conclusions, and the biggest test comes next month in France’s presidential vote. But in elections in the Netherlands, Australia and Germany in recent days the forces of nationalism and populism that have been on the march across First World democracies suffered setbacks.The most recent test came over the weekend in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic Union struck a blow for the political establishment with a convincing victory in the state of Saarland, a good sign for the chancellor ahead of a national vote in September. The Christian Democrats’ secretary-general, Peter Tauber, said voters had “opted for stability and trustworthiness…The CDU is the only force that has made clear it wouldn’t work with either left- or right-wing populists.”In the Netherlands two weeks ago, the Dutch political establishment prevailed against anti-Islam firebrand Geert Wilders. His Party for Freedom, which campaigned for halting Muslim immigration and exiting the European Union, fell short in its challenge to the party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte.Meanwhile, in Australia, the ruling party of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull gambled by joining forces with a controversial nationalist figure, Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party—and was rebuffed. In state elections in Western Australia, her anti-immigrant party won less than 5% of the vote, helping drag the government to defeat.Those results are mere straws in the wind. Still, taken together,they suggest the possibility that the beleaguered political establishment may be learning some lessons and regaining its footing.The reverse seemed true last fall, when British voters defied their prime minister and voted to exit the European Union, and when Donald Trump smashed expectations as well as the establishment leaders in both parties to win his stunning U.S. election victory.Those results gave a shot of adrenaline to economic nationalists and anti-immigrant movements. Those forces still undoubtedly exert more influence than they did just a year ago, but exactly how much influence has been the question.France now looms as the big test case. There, a coming presidential race increasingly appears to be between right-wing nationalist Marine Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron.Onetime front-runner François Fillon is embroiled in scandal and fading, and Ms. Le Pen and Mr. Macron are essentially tied in polls heading into the first round of French voting April 23. The great unknown is how much strength Ms. Le Pen—who has embraced the Trump victory as a turning point in Western politics—can show in the final round of French voting if matched head-to-head against Mr. Macron.A weekend poll in France showed Mr. Macron well ahead in a matchup against Ms. Le Pen. But the poll also showed a large share of French voters remains undecided. That big chunk of uncommitted voters, plus the possibility that the French are shy about admitting to pollsters their support for the controversial Ms. Le Pen, means it would be foolish to discount her chance of winning the presidency.If she does prevail, she will push for a French exit from the European Union to match the British one, for a clampdown on immigration and for a much warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Nationalism will be recharged.On the other hand, Ms. Le Pen may have gone a bit too far in embracing Mr. Putin during a surprise visit to the Kremlin on Friday, just two days ahead of a Kremlin weekend crackdown on Mr. Putin’s opponents.The rocky opening weeks of the new Trump administration, as well as some buyer’s remorse in the wake of the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom, may have served to erode some of the appeal of populist movements elsewhere.It’s also likely, though, that if the political establishment in the West is regaining its footing, it is doing so in part because it has moved to co-opt some of the nationalist messages of its opponents.The Netherlands’ Mr. Rutte, for example, adopted his own version of an anti-immigrant line, albeit a softer one than that brandished by Mr. Wilders. Mr. Rutte told immigrants that they should adapt to Dutch ways, adding: “If you don’t like it here, you can leave.”Similarly, Ms. Merkel has defended her policies on refugees and immigration, but last fall also offered Germans a bit of an apology for the refugee influx.That, in fact, is what smart, successful parties do: They don’t dismiss the ferment revealed by upstart political movements, but absorb the lessons and adapt. The sentiments unearthed by the Brexit vote and the Trump victory are real and aren’t going away. It may be, though, that the establishment now is learning better how to adapt to them.

Calling Obamacare a \"crisis,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said the GOP is \"in the midst of negotiating finishing touches\" on their new health-care plan. (Reuters) THE MORNING PLUM: House Republicans have been hinting they may introduce a new plan to replace Obamacare before the 100th day of the Trump presidency. Naturally, giving President Trump something to arbitrarily tout as an achievement (even if it passes the House, the Senate looms) in advance of the arbitrary 100-day mark is far more important than the human toll the proposal would have on millions. Now Republicans are indeed set to introduce the new plan, multiple reports tell us. And judging by a new study set to be released today, it is even crueler than the last GOP plan: The study finds premiums would likely soar for the sick, probably pushing them off coverage. opinions plum-line Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Read These Comments The best conversations on The Washington Post Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters The Huffington Post has a detailed rundown of the new GOP plan, which is designed to bridge the gap between moderates and conservatives who rejected the last one for different reasons. It allows states to seek a waiver to get rid of the Affordable Care Act’s prohibition on charging higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions, on the condition that states set up or participate in high-risk pools that would help cover any of those people who lose insurance. It would also restore to the GOP bill the ACA’s requirement that insurers cover Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) — such as doctor’s and emergency room visits and maternity care — but allow states to seek waivers from them. Ryan outlines high-risk pools amendment to GOP health-care plan Embed Copy Share Play Video1:55 House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) announced an amendment to the GOP health-care plan \"to try and find consensus\" after an earlier failure to garner enough conservative support, that introduces high-risk pools to the plan. (Reuters) House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) announced an amendment to the GOP health-care plan \"to try and find consensus\" after an earlier failure to garner enough conservative support, that introduces high-risk pools to the plan. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) announced an amendment to the GOP health-care plan \"to try and find consensus\" after an earlier failure to find enough support. (Reuters) In effect, the waiver on preexisting conditions is designed to make conservatives happy, while giving moderates high-risk pools that allow them to argue it wouldn’t harm people with preexisting conditions. The restoration of EHBs is designed to make moderates happy, while telling conservatives states could still get out from under them. But the waiver on prohibitions against jacking up premiums for people with preexisting conditions — which is called “community rating” — is a major problem. It would smack them with far more in costs — potentially pushing them off coverage entirely. The liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) conducted a new study — set to be released later today — on how much these premiums might soar for people with various preexisting ailments. The “surcharge” in the middle column represents additional premium charges that insurers are projected to add to coverage of each condition annually, and the numbers are eye-popping: Topher Spiro, a health policy analyst at CAP, tells me that these sums were calculated by using actuary “risk scores” for each condition, which detail how much someone with that condition costs insurers relative to a healthy person. (Focus on the first two columns for now; the third will be elucidated by the report itself.) “If insurers can charge sick people higher premiums than healthy people, they would add a surcharge to premiums that reflects this additional cost,” Spiro says. “The premium markups would be unimaginable, adding thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars to premiums. They would be priced out of the market and quarantined into high-risk pools.” Now, in fairness, these findings are based on calculated national averages, so applying them to what would happen in any given state is tricky. But this is intended as a general guideline of what sort of premium hikes we might see in states that did seek waivers — and it’s fair to assume many red states would do so. What’s more, this conclusion dovetails with the general conclusions of other health policy analysts. The big story is that, while the new plan would ostensibly keep the prohibition against refusing to cover people with preexisting conditions, allowing premiums to be jacked up would functionally price a lot of those people out of the market, gutting that protection. Indeed, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation’s Larry Levitt tells me he thinks the CAP projections are plausible. “These figures show why a guarantee of coverage without community rating offers essentially no protection for people with pre-existing conditions,” Levitt says. “No insurance company will want to cover people with expensive health conditions if they don’t have to, so they will set premiums to make sure the coverage is out of reach. Health care costs are highly concentrated among a small number of people who are sick, and they would find it impossible to get affordable coverage.” (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press) Of course, the new plan’s defenders would reply that these people can go into high-risk pools (this is apparently meant to give moderates cover to back it). But they’ve historically been underfunded and/or resulted in people paying higher prices or going without coverage. Meanwhile, the new GOP plan would keep in place the old plan’s phase-out of the Medicaid expansion, which would itself result in 14 million fewer people on Medicaid, according to the Congressional Budget Office. You’d think that this, plus the gutting of protections for preexisting conditions, would render the new plan toxic for GOP moderates who, in rejecting the old plan, have confirmed that they are not willing to embrace a massively regressive plan that would push millions of poor and sick people off coverage while delivering an enormous tax cut to the rich. Of course, the need to give Trump a fake achievement to tout is also an urgent matter, so who knows what they’ll do. ******************************************************************** * HOW THE FBI GREW INTERESTED IN CARTER PAGE: The New York Times reports that the FBI’s interest in former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page intensified after he gave a pro-Putin speech in Moscow last July and spent days there in meetings: After Mr. Page … stepped down from the Trump campaign in September, the F.B.I. obtained a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court allowing the authorities to monitor his communications on the suspicion that he was a Russian agent. From the Russia trip of the once-obscure Mr. Page grew a wide-ranging investigation, now accompanied by two congressional inquiries, that has cast a shadow over the early months of the Trump administration. Trump allies maintain that his role was minimal, but Page has said his half year on the campaign was very important to him. Either way, law enforcement is taking this very seriously. * TRUMP SHOULD HURRY UP AND JUST CUT TAXES, SOME SAY: NPR reports that some sympathetic to the Trump administration think he should forget about a broad tax reform overhaul for now and just quickly cut taxes to rack up a win. One former Trump adviser, NPR notes, has been hearing from investors and businesses who “say they’re getting nervous that Trump’s tax cut may not happen.” No Obamacare repeal … no tax cut … what a tragic outcome that would be! * KAREN HANDEL’S VULNERABILITIES: CNN profiles Karen Handel, who is now the GOP candidate in the June runoff against Jon Ossoff in the closely watched House special election. Two key points: [Her] stances on social issues are certain to be a focus in the runoff — particularly her effort to stop the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the breast cancer charity where she was senior vice president for policy, from funding screenings through Planned Parenthood because she opposes abortion rights … Handel’s efforts as secretary of state to purge Georgia’s voter rolls by requiring voters to prove their citizenship led to fights with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. The first could draw more attention when the budget fights over Planned Parenthood cuts pushed by the GOP heat up. The second could help goose Democratic turnout. * DEMOCRATS LAUNCH HUGE AD BLITZ IN GEORGIA: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that Democrats have already unleashed a massive barrage of ads hitting Handel: The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put $450,000 behind an ad that slams Handel as “just another career politician” and questioned her use of public funds while she was Georgia’s secretary of state. And Ossoff’s campaign, restocked with more than $500,000 in donations after Tuesday’s vote, also said it will resume a barrage of ads propping up the former congressional aide on Thursday. That half a million is a sign of continued Democratic energy — the question is whether voters will come out for him a second time. Meanwhile, a GOP group is airing a spot tying Ossoff to Nancy Pelosi. * TRUMP’S FIRST 100 DAYS WERE HISTORICALLY #SAD: Trump says that no president has accomplished more in his first 90 days than Trump has. Glenn Kessler takes a detailed look at the claim and finds that it’s nonsense. As one political scientist puts it: “Trump actually is unusual for his first 100 days, but for a reason opposite of what he said. Not only has he accomplished almost nothing, but rather his initiatives (executive orders stayed by courts, a major legislative proposal failing even to come to a vote when his party controls both houses, etc.) have notoriously been unsuccessful.” Don’t worry, Mr. President, you are breaking new historical ground. * KEEP THE FOCUS ON TRUMP’S AUTOCRACY: E.J. Dionne Jr. has a nice column on Trump’s conduct in office and runs through the list of questions that it raises: Should Trump separate himself completely from his business interests, as presidents had been doing for more than four decades?…Should he release his income-tax returns so the public can see where conflicts might exist — including whether he will benefit from his own tax proposals?… Should he continue former president Barack Obama’s practice of making the White House visitor logs public so all can know who might be influencing his policies? As Dionne notes, Trump’s implicit answer to all of these is: No, I can do what I want. And in this lies not only the potential for corruption but also an autocratic assumption that he is above normal expectations.",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — President Trump signed on Tuesday a much-anticipated executive order intended to roll back most of President Barack Obama’s climate-change legacy, celebrating the move as a way to promote energy independence and to restore thousands of lost coal industry jobs.Flanked by coal miners at a ceremony at the Environmental Protection Agency, Mr. Trump signed a short document titled the “Energy Independence” executive order, directing the agency to start the legal process of withdrawing and rewriting the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of Mr. Obama’s policies to fight global warming.“C’mon fellas. You know what this is? You know what this says?” Mr. Trump said to the miners. “You’re going back to work.”The order also takes aim at a suite of narrower but significant Obama-era climate and environmental policies, including lifting a short-term ban on new coal mining on public lands.The executive order does not address the United States’ participation in the 2015 Paris Agreement, the landmark accord that committed nearly every country to take steps to reduce climate-altering pollution. But experts note that if the Trump program is enacted, it will all but ensure that the United States cannot meet its global warming commitments under the accord.Mr. Trump advertised the moves as a way to decrease the nation’s dependence on imported fuels and revive the flagging coal industry.“We’re ending the theft of American prosperity and reviving our beloved economy,” Mr. Trump said. “The miners told me about the attacks on their jobs. I made them this promise. We will put our miners back to work.”But energy economists say the order falls short of both of those goals — in part because the United States already largely relies on domestic sources for the coal and natural gas that fires most of the nation’s power plants.“We don’t import coal,” said Robert N. Stavins, an energy economist at Harvard University. “So in terms of the Clean Power Plan, this has nothing to do with so-called energy independence whatsoever.”Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, said in an interview on ABC News on Sunday that the order will help the United States “be both pro-jobs and pro-environment.”But coal miners should not assume their jobs will return if Trump’s regulations take effect.The new order would mean that older coal plants that had been marked for closing would probably stay open for a few years longer, extending the demand for coal, said Robert W. Godby, an energy economist at the University of Wyoming.But even so, “the mines that are staying open are using more mechanization,” he said.“They’re not hiring people,” he continued.“So even if we saw an increase in coal production, we could see a decrease in coal jobs,” he added.Legal experts say it could take years for the Trump administration to unwind the Clean Power Plan, which has not yet been carried out because it has been temporarily frozen by a Supreme Court order. Those regulations sought to cut planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution from coal-fired power plants. If enacted, they would have shut down hundreds of those plants, frozen construction of future plants and replaced them with wind and solar farms and other renewable energy sources.Throughout his campaign, Mr. Trump highlighted his support of coal miners, holding multiple rallies in coal country and vowing to restore lost jobs to the flagging industry. At a rally last week in Kentucky, Mr. Trump vowed that his executive order would “save our wonderful coal miners from continuing to be put out of work.”While coal mining jobs have dropped in the United States, they do not represent a significant portion of the American economy. Coal companies employed about 65,971 miners in 2015, down from 87,755 in 2008, according to Energy Department statistics.And though the percentage of coal mining jobs dropped sharply, economists said that was not driven by the Clean Power Plan. Rather, they blamed two key forces: an increase in the production of natural gas, which is a cheaper, cleaner-burning alternative to coal, and an increase in automation, which allowed coal companies to produce more fuel with fewer employees. The rollback of Mr. Obama’s regulations will not change either of those forces, economists say.“The problem with coal jobs has not been CO2 regulations, so this will probably not bring back coal jobs,” Mr. Godby said. “The problem has been that there has not been market demand for coal.”The coal industry nonetheless cheered the move.“These actions are vital to the American coal industry, to our survival, and to getting some of our coal families back to work,” said Robert E. Murray, the chief executive of Murray Energy, one of the nation’s largest coal mining companies. Mr. Murray, a donor to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, stood behind the president as he signed the order.But even Mr. Murray conceded that he did not expect Mr. Trump’s order to return coal mining numbers to their former strength. “I really don’t know how far the coal industry can be brought back,” he said.Mr. Trump’s directive also eliminates about a half-dozen of Mr. Obama’s smaller executive orders and memorandums related to combating climate change.For example, the order would require White House economists to recalculate a budgeting metric known as the social cost of carbon that, under the Obama administration, limited pollution by arguing that global warming outweighed economic benefits for industries. It would also eliminate a requirement that federal agencies consider the impact on climate change when analyzing all future environmental permits.Combined, the measures are likely to ensure the United States’ emissions of planet-warming pollution remain too high to meet the terms of the Paris climate accord.The aim of the Paris deal is to reduce emissions enough to stave off a warming of the planet by more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the level at which, experts say, the Earth will be irrevocably locked into a future of extreme droughts, flooding and shortages of food and water.But analysts say Mr. Trump’s order signals that the United States will not meet its pledges under the Paris deal to cut its emissions about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.“Meeting the U.S. terms of the Paris Agreement would require full enforcement of the current regulations, plus additional regulations,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. “It takes a comprehensive effort involving every country doing what they committed to and more.”He said Mr. Trump’s order “sends a signal to other countries that they might not have to meet their commitments — which would mean that the world would fail to stay out of the climate danger zone.”",

      "text" : "The luxury electric-car company Tesla has yet to turn a profit, losing hundreds of millions of dollars last year alone. But on Monday, the darling of Silicon Valley became the most valuable American car company, surpassing General Motors, the Detroit granddaddy with $10 billion in sales on nearly 10 million vehicles. Shares of Tesla, run by high-profile chief executive Elon Musk, put the company’s value at $51.5 billion, above GM’s $50.2 billion. Tesla blew by Ford ($44.6 billion) last week. Musk’s company produced just 84,000 cars last year, with starting prices of $68,000. The story of Tesla’s rise speaks to the divided American economy in 2017. Eco-friendly government tax credits, a boom in financial backing and the promise of futuristic innovation have created in Tesla a badge for the drivers who can afford its lofty prices. Tesla production zooms to new record Embed Copy Share Play Video0:57 (Reuters) Tesla delivered a record 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, a sixty-nine percent increase from the previous year. Tesla delivered a record 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, a sixty-nine percent increase from the previous year. (Reuters) At the same time, Tesla, with its long-running saga of production problems, hasn’t come close to fulfilling its mass-market ambitions. Beyond selling far fewer cars than its Detroit rivals, its automated factories employ a fraction of GM’s factory workforce. Tesla’s stock-market rise has made Musk one of the country’s richest people and given him widespread influence, including another meeting with President Trump on Tuesday. But even critics who say Tesla could represent a technology bubble in the stock market acknowledge that the company’s success points to a new reality in the automotive industry that will reshape the experience of driving for most Americans. “This is the ultimate bubble, which is doomed to burst,” former GM vice chairman Bob Lutz said. “Tesla cars are fine, but the business model is not,” he said, pointing to the high cost of production, which is not recovered in the sale price. But, he added, “all legacy car companies will soon have a variety” of similar electric vehicles. Tesla has two models for sale and a third due this year. The Model S starts at $68,000 and goes up to $134,000, depending on power and speed. The Tesla Model X, its sport-utility vehicle, begins at $85,000. Its midmarket entry, the long-awaited Tesla Model 3, is expected to hit showrooms in the second half of the year and is priced around $35,000. At that price, the Model 3 will compete with GM’s Chevrolet all-electric Bolt and Ford’s all-electric Focus. Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners, said Tesla competes in a rarefied market: “The car is a high-performance, luxury car that happens to have an electric engine,” Feinseth said. “It competes with BMW, Mercedes and Lexus.” The stratospheric climb of Tesla’s stock price from $40 in 2013 to more than $312 in trading on Monday, propelled the company to its highest value yet.

The Switch's Todd Frankel talks about being inside a self-driving car. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) A stock analyst’s recommendation to buy Tesla shares is “one of the more absurd I’ve seen in a while,” said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington, a D.C. investment firm. He noted that the company is forecast to lose money in 2018 but that the stock is expected to increase to $368 a share. “Investors were asked to employ a ‘creative’ valuation methodology. I think that means that when the numbers don’t make any sense, one should ignore them and focus on other things,” Farr said. “It’s like being told to ignore the flames coming out of that airplane, I’m sure your trip will be fine.” Feinseth said when you look at Tesla’s potential for growth, its dealer network, supply chain and the quality of the Tesla car itself, the value makes more sense. “It’s not unusual to value growth companies even to the point of being a little crazy,” Feinseth said. Tesla’s reputation as beyond-a-car company — it recently absorbed Musk’s Solar City company for $5 billion — has captured the imagination of California’s technology pack and, apparently, investors. The company has been developing batteries that could store power from rooftop solar panels, expanding its mission into a renewable-energy enterprise. Tesla also is exploring technology for self-driving cars. Musk’s outreach to Trump and the new administration’s emphasis on U.S. manufacturing is working to Tesla’s advantage, helping propel the stock even more since the November election and by more than 40 percent since January. [Tesla’s feat of financial engineering] “The market is willing to say I’m going to value you based on what I think your future potential is, and it could be off of what you think they could make selling cars, what they could make selling batteries, what they could make selling solar or what they could make as a mobility company,” said Matthew Stover, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group. “Everything is on the table, and it’s all speculative.” Musk, 45, is a South African-born Canadian American business mogul with an estimated net worth of $14.8 billion, according to the latest estimates by Forbes magazine. He made his fortune selling money-transfer- service PayPal to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Like Amazon.com founder (and Washington Post owner) Jeffrey P. Bezos, Musk is known for pursuits that take him beyond his primary business. Bezos, through Blue Origin, and Musk, through SpaceX, have launched private companies aimed at human spaceflight. Despite’s GM’s dominance in car sales (its U.S. market share is 17.3 percent compared with 0.2 percent for Tesla), analysts admire what Musk has built. “Making cars is a hard business,” Feinseth said, “and putting together in such a short time a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility along with a dealer and showrooms and a support network of service centers and charging facilities, that is very hard.” [The battle between Tesla and your neighborhood car dealership] Despite the engaging story, the Tesla ending is still up for grabs. business economy true Economy & Business Alerts Breaking news about economic and business issues.

      "text" : "Getty WAR ROOM Russia is deeply complicit in the Syrian tragedy. Stopping Assad requires standing up to Moscow. By Molly K. McKewApril 08, 2017As U.S. Tomahawk missiles soared over the Mediterranean toward Syria’s al-Shayrat airbase, speculation was already flying about how the attack would affect the thaw in U.S.-Russia relations anticipated since Donald Drumpf took office. Was this a first sign that America’s new president was willing to stand up to Putin?Arguably the more critical factor in the equation is Russia. To understand the Kremlin’s response to the U.S. strike, and to the preceding chemical attack in Syria, it’s important to face some brutal truths about Russia in Syria.Story Continued BelowThe U.S. warned Russian forces about the coming strike because we knew they were there. We knew Russians were at Shayrat airbase since at least November 2015. This is why Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev warned that this strike was “on the brink of combat clashes with Russia”: We were bombing a base from which he knew Russian forces guided operations.In August 2015—well before the Kremlin announced its new Syrian campaign — Russia signed a comprehensive military agreement with Assad. This agreement gave Moscow virtual carte blanche in Syria, and gave Syria a status equivalent to occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia rather than to other sovereign nations where Russian forces are housed.Russian commanders coordinate the military strategy in Syria, and have been critical to reversing the course of the war against Assad. Russian forces coordinate all aspects of Syrian air power and airstrikes. They reinforced the infrastructure of Shayrat airbase—which supposedly had its chemical stockpiles removed in 2013. There is no chance that, in the course of reconstructing elements of the base, they were not made aware that there were chemical munitions present. Washington and the World By Blake HounshellAccording to some reports, intelligence sources have confirmed that Russian personnel were present at the base when the chemical munitions were being loaded onto Syrian fighters. Russian air assets may have been over the site of the chemical attack when it occurred, and a Russian drone scouted a hospital treating the victims of the sarin attack just before it was bombed—possibly to destroy evidence of the attack. Bombing hospitals has been part of the strategy of war in Syria.All this means that Russian forces likely knew about the sarin attack—the same way they have known about all the Syrian barrel bombs and chlorine attacks, and have been integrally involved in the planning and execution of the strategy of which those attacks were a part. They are fully integrated into the command hierarchy of the Syrian campaign.In Ukraine, for too long, we played along with the Russian kabuki of “little green men” and “separatist forces” when it was clear there were Russian men and materiel on the front lines. War Room By Philip GordonWe must now confront a similar truth—and the consequences—in Syria. There is effectively no Syrian army anymore. There are Russian commanders and Iranian and Hezbollah ground forces. Russia has far greater technological capabilities, and also has the expertise in precision munitions. So fill in the blanks. Syria is a Russian war.Why would Assad or Putin take such a risk with this chemical attack, or any of the others? The Kremlin and its generals understand the usefulness of fear, and of massive demographic engineering and the weaponization of migration, and of the destabilization of the region to achieve specific gains. Remember: Chaos is often a Kremlin strategy. Russian forces were warned of the coming retaliatory strike. Their A2AD air defense systems could have defended Shayrat against missile strikes. They didn’t. Washington And The World By Charles ListerAt that moment, officials in the Kremlin had an opportunity, but they also made a choice. They could have thrown Assad under the bus—said they were unaware of the attack, condemned it, or at least said that it must be investigated impartially, etc.They didn't. Instead, the Kremlin made up stories about how Assad was not responsible, launching conspiracies about rebel chemical factories and “provocations.” In fact, they went further, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs implying that every chemical attack during the Syrian war had been staged to tar Assad. So the Kremlin has made its choice. By covering for Assad and blaming America, Russian leaders deserve no further opportunities to deny their sins. And we should stop doing it for them. Washington And The World By Susan B. GlasserThe truth is: Russia is complicit in the use of sarin gas against civilians in Syria. But getting caught, embarrassing as it might be, is useful to the Kremlin, too. Putin understands that Drumpf’s missile attack could be the narrative pivot he needs to escape the consequences of his actions.Already, hopes for a reset were fading in Moscow. The Kremlin has become increasingly concerned that Drumpf is constrained by investigations and the public’s anti-Russian sentiments, and that their efforts to cultivate a friendly face in the White House will yield nothing. That means they have two options: Force their opponent to work harder for the deal, or else return to the narrative of America as “the main opponent.”Either is a win for Putin, and both were achieved by allowing the strike. FOURTH ESTATE By Jack ShaferThe Kremlin reality-distortion machine is at full churn, spewing out outrage and diversion: the U.S. bombed Syria to distract from civilian casualties in Iraq; it was really to send a message to North Korea; Drumpf was trying to reverse declining approval ratings; the U.S. is supporting ISIS; the sarin attack was a “provocation” meant to force President Drumpf back from his softening position on the longevity of Assad’s reign.But this time, the churn can’t drown out the truth. Bombing Syria re-established that the U.S. is still a player in the Middle East. It was an act of American strength. But a one-off bombing of one of Assad’s bases did not establish a position of American strength. Putin moves into vacuums—physically and ideologically—and the U.S. left too many during the Obama years. Without a policy on Russia—not on Syria or Ukraine, but on Russia itself, and not to react to Putin, but to shape what comes next—Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is still heading to Moscow to negotiate from a position of weakness. 1600 Penn By Jeffrey SonnenfeldAs I wrote in January, Drumpf has the tools and characteristics to be able to stand against Putin’s global imperialist insurgency, including in the Middle East, should he choose to do so. Strength requires strategy. And it’s time that we have one again on Russia, and for all the many wars the Kremlin is waging against us and our interests. But this requires seeing through the Kremlin’s fairytales and accepting the truth of their actions.Molly K.

      "text" : "The stunning collapse of the Republican health-care bill now imperils the rest of President Trump’s ambitious congressional agenda, with few prospects for quick victory on tax reform, construction projects or a host of other issues in the months ahead despite complete GOP control of government. While Republicans broadly share the goal of Trump’s promised “big tax cuts,” the president will have to bridge many of the same divides within his own party that sunk the attempted overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. And without savings anticipated from the health-care bill, paying for the “massive” cuts Trump has promised for corporations and middle-class families becomes considerably more complicated. Meanwhile, other marquee agenda items, including a $1 trillion investment in roads and other infrastructure and proposed crackdowns on both legal and illegal immigration, will require the support of Democrats, many of whom have been alienated by the highly partisan start to Trump’s tenure. The lone exception for near-term victory could come with the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch — but even that faces the prospect of a threatened filibuster by Democrats. Trump and Republican leaders continued Saturday in their attempts to put a brave face on the health-care debacle. “ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE,” Trump wrote in a morning tweet. “Do not worry!” What happened to Trump's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare 'on Day 1'? Embed Copy Share Play Video1:13 (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) President Trump promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act “immediately” and “on Day 1” while on the campaign trail. But now, he claims he never said he'd get health care reform done quickly. What happened to Trump's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare 'on Day 1'? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) [‘The closer’? The inside story of how Trump tried — and failed — to get a deal on health care] But others in the party acknowledged the political damage sustained by pulling the House bill, particularly for a president who had touted his own dealmaking prowess. “It’s a momentum issue,” said Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.). “The fact is that, you know, you came out of the gate and you stumbled.” Doug Heye, a GOP consultant and former congressional staffer, said Republicans, having achieved control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, were left with a lot to prove. “It sends a troubling sign to a lot of folks about the broader issue of whether Republicans will be able to govern,” he said. Trump has said he would have preferred to start his term by cutting “the hell out of taxes.” Even before the health-care bill was pulled Friday, the president was already starting to turn the page. Determined to highlight other priorities, Trump staged two announcements in the White House meant to underscore his commitment to creating jobs: granting a construction permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and appearing with executives of a telecom giant as they pledged to hire thousands of new employees, although the company’s plans had already been announced in October. View Graphic Which Republicans forced Trump to pull the health-care bill Separately, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at an event Friday that he will push Congress to enact comprehensive tax reform by its August recess, though he acknowledged that the timetable might slip. The White House signaled Saturday that it was eager to move on. Trump’s weekly address made no mention of the health-care fight, instead focusing on his signing of legislation authorizing funding for NASA and his commitment to space exploration. “We’re going to roll our sleeves up, and we’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms,” Vice President Pence said Saturday at an appearance in Scott Depot, W.Va. A senior White House official, however, said it was unlikely that Trump would ramp up a major sales effort on tax reform immediately, given that his team had been planning on using the coming days to push for Senate action on the health-care bill. Trump’s top advisers had envisioned a three-step legislative agenda this year, starting with scaling back President Barack Obama’s signature domestic initiative. After that was complete, they wanted to move to a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code, followed by the creation of a $1 trillion infrastructure package. The implosion of the health-care effort complicates the tax overhaul both logistically and politically. House Republicans leaders had been counting on changes to the tax code included in the health-care bill to make the task of paying for future tax cuts easier. [Trump learns that dealmaking is not the same as leadership] Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist said the bloc of hard line Republicans who helped stymie the health-care overhaul were guilty of “ripping the lungs out of tax reform.” If they don’t revisit the health-care bill immediately, Norquist said, they will soon realize that “they didn’t shoot and wound health-care reform, they shot and killed permanent tax reform.” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) acknowledged Friday that the health-care defeat “does make tax reform more difficult, but it does not make it impossible.” “We are going to proceed with tax reform,” Ryan said. Hours before the health bill was pulled, Mnuchin said a “comprehensive” overhaul of the tax code should prove less complex. “Health care is a very, very complicated issue,” he said at a Friday event hosted by Axios. “In a way, [tax reform is] a lot simpler. It really is.” Trump has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, though many Republicans on Capitol Hill have been aiming for a 20 percent rate. Trump has also proposed consolidating the existing seven individual income-tax brackets into three brackets of 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent. Trump’s advisers have argued that these changes would trigger a big expansion of economic growth, but some budget analysts have said the changes would widen the deficit by anywhere from $2.6 trillion to $7 trillion over 10 years, depending on how it is measured. Many Republicans have long vowed that an overhaul of the tax code must be “revenue neutral,” which means they need to find new revenue to offset the reduction in rates. Trump’s advisers have not identified specific tax breaks they would eliminate to raise new revenue, and Trump himself often waved away debt concerns during the campaign. [The ACA’s future is in Trump’s hands. His plan: ‘Let Obamacare explode’] Meanwhile, House and Senate Republicans are at odds over the wisdom of a key component of tax reform. Ryan has proposed a border-adjustment tax that would essentially create new taxes on items imported into the United States as a way to raise close to $1 trillion in new revenue while also providing incentives for companies to move operations to the United States. Many other Republicans oppose this idea, though, and the fight probably will only intensify now. Some Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), argue that the scheme would drive up prices on consumer goods and many large retailers are strongly opposed. Given such divides, as well as the mechanics of the budget process, it’s highly unlikely that lawmakers will produce a comprehensive tax bill by the August recess, if at all, said Jim Manley, a former longtime aide to former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). “It’s clearly not realistic, and it’s not going to happen, on policy and political grounds,” Manley said, adding that the Republican agenda is also undercut by “a president who’s out of his league and doesn’t know how to legislate.” Republicans had planned to use a budget procedure called “reconciliation” for both the health-care overhaul and for the tax changes, as that would allow them to pass their plans with a simple majority in the Senate and make it impossible for Democrats to block the changes through a filibuster. That’s still the plan with tax reform. Barry Bennett, an adviser to Trump during the general election, said he thought it was a “tactical mistake” for the president not to have started his term by pushing for tax changes. “Now you’re going to have to carry these battle scars into the tax debate,” he said. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who was a close adviser to Trump during the campaign, said the White House should postpone what is expected to be a messy battle over the tax code and instead pivot toward trying to build a large infrastructure package. Proceeding with infrastructure could attract bipartisan support, he said. Some Democrats and labor unions have said they could support a big infrastructure package, though the White House has not specified how it plans to finance a package that includes roads, bridges, airports and broadband capability, among other things. Mnuchin said Friday that the package would likely include several hundred billion dollars in public money but the rest would be financed by the private sector, with public support as incentives. Democrats are wary of that approach and prefer more direct government spending. Many Democrats and Republicans have tried — but failed — to pull off tax reform in recent years. A principal reason changing the tax code is so difficult is because interest groups flood Washington looking for tax cuts but fight vigorously against any measure that would increase their bills. “It’s very, very hard to get done,” said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who served as economic adviser to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) when he ran for president in 2008. “There are tons of different interests involved, and there are very different views within the Republican Party. Now you are going to enter into a second exercise of that type where you have clear evidence that holdouts can kill it. That empowers the holdouts.” Gingrich said the White House could learn some lessons from the failed House health-care effort and change its approach going forward. “I hope [Trump is] going to decide that he has to have a much more hands-on approach to drafting these things and can’t just assume that it’s going to show up,” Gingrich said. Despite contentions by White House press secretary Sean Spicer that Trump “left everything on the field” while lobbying for the health-care bill, other Republicans suggested he could have played a more assertive role starting earlier in the process. “If Trump is going to be best advocate, he needs to be more aggressive,” Heye said. “I’d try to do some sort of autopsy and figure out how to do this better.” Democratic leaders said Republicans would be doomed to failure in future debates if they didn’t seek to build more consensus. “We don’t know what they’ll do with tax reform,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who warned, “if it’s huge tax cuts for the wealthy . . . it won’t fly.” Looming on the Senate calendar is a confirmation vote for Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. Senate Democrats have said they plan to force Gorsuch to clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle, forcing Republicans to try to find eight Democrats to cross over and vote to advance the nomination. Republicans have raised the prospect of turning to the “nuclear option” to force through Gorsuch’s nomination, a rule change that could further strain relations beyond the parties and undermine prospects for cooperation on other matters. politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Local Politics Alerts Breaking news about local government in D.C., Md., Va.

See all newsletters Beyond Gorsuch, Congress is facing a late-April deadline to pass a stopgap spending bill to keep the federal government running. That could also spark a partisan clash that could risk a government shutdown. Senate Democrats have warned that they are willing to risk a shutdown fight if Republicans include funding in that package to construct a U.S.-Mexico border wall, another marquee campaign promise from Trump. Budget analysts fear Congress must also reach an agreement to raise or suspend the debt ceiling by August or September or the Treasury Department could run out of flexibility to continue paying the government’s bills. Trump, on Friday and in the days leading up to the vote, seemed undaunted by the challenges ahead. “I hope that it’s going to all work out,” he told a House Republican dinner before the collapse of the health-care bill. “Then we immediately start on the tax cuts, and they’re going to be really fantastic, and I am looking forward to that one. That one’s going to be fun.”",

      "text" : "The Pentagon announced Monday it will begin a new review of its nuclear posture at the direction of President Trump, amid rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula over Pyongyang’s missile firings and potentially a sixth nuclear test. Pentagon chief spokesperson Dana W. White said in a statement that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will ensure the U.S. military’s nuclear force is “safe, secure, effective, reliable and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our allies.” The U.S. military has roughly 450 long-range nuclear missiles in underground silos at various bases in the Midwest. It also maintains a fleet of ballistic missile submarines as well as long range B-2 and B-52 bombers also capable of launching nuclear weapons. Smaller nuclear weapons can be carried by U.S. Air Force fighter jets. According to the latest Pentagon statement, “Secretary Mattis directed the commencement of the review, which will be led by the deputy secretary of defense and the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and include interagency partners. The process will culminate in a final report to the president by the end of the year.\" The Pentagon’s posture review comes two days after North Korea failed to launch a new type of ballistic missile, which exploded four seconds after launch. U.S. officials told Fox News the North Korean missile was a KN-17, a new type of Scud, which could be used to target ships similar to the one launched earlier this month days before Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. “The only way a Scud gets a new designation is if it is substantially different,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a scholar at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. The KN-17 is a single-stage, liquid-fueled missile -- not the three-stage, solid-fuel missile that North Korea successfully tested back in February, which caused more concern among Pentagon officials. The latest failed test over the weekend occurred hours before Vice President Pence touched down in Seoul. On Monday, he visited the Demilitarized Zone on the border between North and South and warned the rogue communist regime against conducting further tests. \"There was a period of strategic patience. But the era of strategic patience is over. President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out, and we want to see change,'' Pence said. Aside from the rumblings out of North Korea, Russia recently deployed a ground-based, nuclear-capable cruise missile in violation of a decades-long arms treaty between Washington and Moscow, drawing condemnation from Capitol Hill lawmakers. The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between the United States and the then-Soviet Union required complete “destruction” of ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 310 and 3,418 miles and support equipment by 1990. On Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked Deputy National Security Adviser KT McFarland on “Fox News Sunday” if the U.S. played a role in North Korea’s failed test launch over the weekend. “You know we can't talk about secret intelligence and things that might have been done, covert operations that might have happened. So, I really have no comment on that, and nor should I,” McFarland said. She added, “I do think we are entering a whole new era, not just with North Korea, but with everybody, with any country, major country, we are entering a cyber platform, a cyber battlefield.” The USS Carl Vinson strike group remains off the coast of Australia and will not begin the voyage north for another couple of days following a training exercise, according to officials. Vinson will arrive in the Sea of Japan around April 24, officials tell Fox. Lucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.

My engagement ring diamond is too large!: Seriously, the diamond in my engagement ring is way too large! I know this sounds like a humblebrag or the rant of a crazy person, but it is true. My fiancé and I have been talking marriage for a couple of years, and he proposed over the holidays. I said yes of course. He didn’t have a ring and said he was going to surprise me with one. All good so far—honestly I love this guy to the moon and back so I was thrilled. Then two weeks ago he gave me the ring. It is huge, like something one of the Real Housewives would sport, and it is just not my thing. I am not a jewelry person at all. I hadn’t given much thought to a ring, but I thought something nice and tasteful would be great. This isn’t that. I told my fiancé how I felt and he kind of shut down. But finally he admitted that he thinks the diamond needs to be bigger than the one his brother gave to his fiancée. They are super competitive and always have been. Seriously, I do not want this ring, and I don’t want to be part of a war between brothers either. I found the receipt for the ring, and it cost more than a year of my fiancé’s salary! We can’t afford this! I don’t know what to do. This is making me rethink how my fiancé is, and I’m not liking what I see. Do you see any solutions here? A: What an exciting opportunity to pursue healthy conflict you have been presented with! Your fiancé presumably wishes to marry you, not his brother and sister-in-law, therefore your opinion about the engagement ring is really the only one that counts. You don’t have to let yourself get encased in diamonds just to satisfy his weird, jewel-based rivalry with his brother. “The last time I tried to talk to you about my engagement ring, you shut down, but that’s not how I want us to handle conflict in our relationship. We need to be able to talk about these things, and it’s really worrying me that you seem more concerned with showing up your brother than what I want. I don’t like this ring. I’m not interested in lugging a giant rock around that doesn’t reflect my tastes and makes me feel self-conscious, and I want to feel like my preferences are important to you. I would like to return this ring and pick out a less expensive one together. I’d also like to talk about why you felt like you ‘needed’ to buy a bigger diamond than your brother did, and the fact that you were willing to spend an entire year’s salary on it. Can we do that?” Pay attention to your feelings! If you continue to not like what you see from your fiancé even after you have a follow-up conversation, consider giving the ring back altogether. Subscribe to Prudie! Q. Involuntary Peeping Tom: I live in a Southern state, and our home is located in a community of houses that are built pretty close together. Our neighborhood is a mix of families and young professionals. My husband and I have a 15-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter. Our newish neighbor is an attractive woman in her early 30s. I don’t know her very well, but she seems perfectly nice. My issue involves the fact that she likes to lounge naked by the small pool in her yard. I found out that you can see her from our backyard deck when I caught my giggling son and his friend pointing her out. My husband and I spoke with my son about respecting someone’s privacy, that he shouldn’t make a spectacle of it, or God forbid take photos of her (I hoped to not have to say that to my kid, but in this digital age, it felt necessary to make clear). I brought it up to the neighbor in a “just so you know” way once, when I found out, and she kind of laughed and said she’d keep it in mind. But she continues to do it. And I know it’s her home, and she can lay/walk/dance naked on her property all she wants. And I don’t want to make the neighbor defensive about doing something totally legal. My husband and I aren’t even that bothered by it (although I’m sure my husband is bothered by it less), but I worry now about having people over and hanging out on the deck (like, “don’t worry—that’s just our naked neighbor, try not to peek, pass the wine”) or more importantly, I now worry if my kids have their friends over on the deck (do I have to tell their parents, like sorry, there might be a naked woman within your kid’s line of sight, but we’ll have snacks?). And if I do bring it up again, do you have any suggestions on what to say? A: You’ve already mentioned it to your neighbor and she’s declined to stop lounging naked, so I don’t think there’s any reason to bring it up with her again, especially since, as you acknowledge, she’s free to do what she likes in her own yard. Your approach thus far seems fairly reasonable—generally you try not to look, and encourage everyone else in your family to do the same. If, however, you worry about making guests feel uncomfortable when they visit, consider putting up an awning or a series of deck umbrellas that block the view. It’s not as expensive as adding another six feet to your backyard fence, but it will spare you at least some of the worry that your next dinner party will be highlighted by unexpected nudity. (Expected nudity is fine.) Advertisement Q. He works hard for her money: My dear, sweet fiancé and I are both divorced, and in short, his divorce agreement sucks. I silently suspected this, but his lawyer confirmed it is “punishing.” For many ill-advised reasons, he signed it without counsel and four years later he’s using mediation to request some modifications to alimony (an uncapped percentage of his income for 10-plus years) and visitation (none stipulated). While their co-parenting relationship is very cordial, I’m skeptical his highly educated ex-wife will agree to jeopardize her status as a stay-at-home mother. If we married, I’m anticipating resentment at watching a growing 60 percent of his income—he’s likely to increase his income significantly in the next few years—go out the door. If nothing changes, can I distance myself from his painful finances with separate bank accounts? By remaining unmarried? Is this just a case of accepting someone with their (contractual) baggage? I don’t have kids, work, and am financially independent, so it’s not about the money for me. It wouldn’t be so hard if a chunk went to a college fund, or a trust for his kids. But, how can we start a life together and watch someone else live so comfortably off of his/our labor? A: You can put off your marriage for another five or six years, if you’re not in a rush, or you and your fiancé could maintain separate finances after you get married. You could also get a prenup of your own together to protect your own assets and make sure that you don’t set yourself up for future financially unequal arrangements. The fact that your fiancé is currently attempting to amend his divorce agreement suggests that he’s making progress and becoming a better advocate for himself, both financially and personally. Talk to him (and a lawyer! and a couples counselor!) about what your goals are for your future partnership, what you’re afraid of, what you resent, and what you hope for as a couple. This is challenging but surmountable, I think, and you have multiple options before you, none of them perfect but all of them workable. Q. Should I cut ties with broke friend?: My friend died 13 years ago, leaving his wife $1 million in life insurance. Since then, she has lived a high lifestyle. She bought two high-end cars, put in a spa that she keeps heated 24/7 “just in case” she feels like using it, remodeled her kitchen as a way to employ a boyfriend, and buys pot and booze for all her hanger-on friends. I’ve helped her over the years by doing her taxes, finding her a financial adviser, and keeping her home in good repair, all for free because I felt that this honored her late husband, who was my good friend. Well, she’s burned through the money, and is angry that the financial adviser can’t help her. She was warned years ago that this day was coming. I’ve tried to get her to live within her means, but she didn’t listen. She now needs to sell the cars and the house. I could help her navigate this, but I just want to walk away and let her end up homeless. Am I a bad person? Should I help her? I’m so angry. Her late husband looked out for her, even in death, and this feels like she’s spitting in his face. A: You have helped her navigate this—you provided her with a financial adviser and have assisted her with her taxes for well over a decade. You are helping her by not intervening now. She is an adult who has had plenty of time to prepare for this day, and she has multiple options now; if she has numerous assets she could sell in order to finance her downsized lifestyle and is capable of finding a job; homelessness is not an immediate threat. Wish her the best and encourage her to take her financial adviser’s advice. That’s all the help you can, or should, offer her now. Advertisement Q. Coming out, take two?: I’m a trans guy in my early 20s. I’m out to my partner, friends, colleagues, professors ... pretty much everyone except my own parents, who are conservative, religious, and unlikely to take it well. (I know this because I tried to tell them at a young age; they threatened conversion therapy if I didn’t shut up about it, so I did. I don’t know what they made of my profoundly unhappy teenage years and continued “androgynous” presentation, but I think they believe this really was a “phase.”) I’ve been approved for top surgery, and my friends have raised thousands of dollars to cover the costs, for which I’m enormously grateful—I haven’t reached the necessary amount yet, but I’m on my way. My question is: When do I need to talk to my parents? My partner worries that if I don’t give them the chance to contribute, they’ll be (or claim to be) even more betrayed, and that even if they aren’t interested in supporting me financially, they need to know about the surgery before it happens or their reaction will be far worse. I’m just scared that they’ll try to stop me (and frankly anticipate being disowned anyway). Is our relationship inherently worth fighting for because they raised me, even if the mistakes they made in the process left me suicidal? And if so, how do you come out to someone you know will hate you for it? A: You do not need to invite your parents’ input before getting top surgery, much less give them the chance to contribute financially. Since you anticipate being disowned, it’s probably unlikely they’re going to turn a complete about-face and offer to help pay for it. You are not in any way obligated to disclose any medical procedures you undergo during transition. Getting surgery (especially surgery you have to pay for out-of-pocket) is stressful enough on its own. If you feel like this is a conversation you’d rather postpone, then postpone it until you feel prepared to do so. The important thing to bear in mind, I think, is that the conversation you want to eventually have with your parents is “I’m transgender,” not “I’m transgender, and I’m pursuing the following medical aspects of transitioning, and welcome your input.” You cannot “betray” your parents by being transgender or getting top surgery; you are an adult and have the final (and only!) say over your own body. Given that the last conversation you had with your parents about being trans resulted in the threat of conversion therapy, it’s understandable that you would rather hold off on having a follow-up until after you’ve been able to recover from surgery. Tell your parents in your own time—or not at all. If you decide you do want to (re)tell them, keep it simple. “Mom, Dad, I told you I was transgender when I was young, and at the time you reacted so angrily I didn’t feel comfortable mentioning it to you again. I want to give you the opportunity to know me better now, if you’re willing. I’m still trans.” If they display any sort of willingness to listen without making threats, then maybe you can figure out a different sort of adult relationship; if their reaction is the same as it was the first time, you don’t owe them a relationship just because they raised you. Q. Responsibility: When I was 18, I dated this boy. I was a really terrible girlfriend—emotionally manipulative, mean, and eventually kissed someone else. We broke up messily, tried again, I wasn’t worthy enough, I had a mental breakdown, and I don’t date anymore. Two weeks ago, I got a message from someone who dated him. Turns out, he finds girls who are sort of like me, and treats them the same way I treated him. Since this started with me and is essentially my fault what is my responsibility to these women? What should I do to apologize and mitigate their trauma? Advertisement A: Nothing. You are not responsible for how your ex treats the people he dates after you; none of us are responsible for how our exes behave in the world, and thank God for that. Take care of yourself and your own mental health. It sounds like you’ve been through a great deal over the last few years and should be focusing on your own well-being. It was presumably surprising to hear from a stranger who had also dated your ex and felt raw enough about it that she contacted you out of the blue, but you don’t owe her (or anyone else) anything other than basic respect and politeness. I’ll say it again because I think it bears repeating: Your ex-boyfriend’s behavior is not your responsibility. The fact that you were not a good girlfriend to him at 18 does not mean you have “doomed” him to recreate your past behavior. Whatever trauma (or mere unpleasantness) his future girlfriends may or may not have experienced, there’s nothing you can do to make them feel any better; they’ll have to do it for themselves and with the support of their own social circles. Q. Re: Should I cut ties with broke friend?: You don’t need to help your friend anymore, but it might be useful to stop judging every little move she makes. Heating her spa 24/7 is hardly luxurious—we bought a house with a hot tub and whether we keep it heated or not barely makes a difference in our electric bill. A: I have no idea how much it costs to heat a hot tub! Good to know. Q. Who is Mother’s Day for?: I love my spouse and teen kids, but they treat me like a maid rather than a relative. I’ve tried various ways to get them to do their share, but they firmly believe housework is 100 percent on me. Like, they will literally drop trash in the middle of a floor when I am cleaning it and expect me to pick it up. Last year I said, “No Mother’s Day until you treat me with respect,” because getting a card doesn’t make up for being treated poorly the rest of the year and in fact kind of makes the contrast more painful. Spouse said, “I know you didn’t want a card, but I bought you one anyway.” Sigh. I just reiterated that this year, unless they change their ways, I do not want to celebrate Mother’s Day. Now they are all mad at me. Spouse isn’t speaking to me. Is Mother’s Day for me, the mother, in which case I can legitimately claim some say in what happens? Or am I obliged to let them pretend that a card and a box of candy make up for being treated poorly 364 days a year? I know they “love” me, in the sense that they are happy someone is around to clean up their shit, but just once I would relish being listened to. Top Comment I was treated like the maid by my family. I went on strike. More... Join In A: I think you should stop cleaning up their shit. Your kids aren’t toddlers, they’re teenagers; in a few years they will be living independently and won’t be able to rely on the fact that their roommates love them unconditionally and are willing to do their laundry and dishes for them. I also think you should consider leaving your spouse, because they’re not willing to treat you with respect, and give you the silent treatment for complaining about being treated like a maid. I think, in fact, that you should quit your job as family maid, whether you decide to leave or not. Figure out what you would like to do that would make you happy, whether that’s taking up hiking or a team sport or going out with friends of your own who treat you like a human being and not Rosie from The Jetsons—something that doesn’t revolve around catering to your spouse and children’s every whim.

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/21st-century-fox-bill-oreilly-wont-be-returning-to-fox-news-channel-1492627732Fox News is parting ways with Bill O’Reilly in the wake of a sexual-harassment scandal, bringing an end to the combative host’s two-decade run that drew millions of loyal viewers and helped build the network’s political influence.The decision to cut ties with Mr. O’Reilly, a staple of the Fox News Channel since its launch in 1996, is a sea change for both the network and its parent company 21st Century Fox . FOX -0.80% Mr. O’Reilly’s take-no-prisoners approach to hosting and glee in belittling those he disagreed with became the template for much of the network’s programming strategy. The absence of Mr. O’Reilly’s “no spin zone” will be the most high-profile change for viewers in the last 10 months that has also seen the exit of Fox New Chairman Roger Ailes and popular host Megyn Kelly.Mr. O’Reilly is being swept out of Fox News after revelations that he and the company paid settlements to women who accused him of sexual harassment and verbal abuse. A New York Times report detailing the $13 million paid to five women who worked at or appeared on his show led to dozens of advertisers boycotting his program and brought a slew of negative attention to the company.While the company initially defended him, the emergence of more complaints against Mr. O’Reilly during an internal probe by law firm Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP became the deciding factor in the Murdoch family’s decision, according to a person familiar with the matter.“After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the company and Bill O’Reilly have agreed that Bill O’Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,” 21st Century Fox said in a statement Wednesday. Mr. O’Reilly, who announced on the air last week that he was taking a vacation until April 24, cut his Italy trip short amid the firestorm and returned to New York on Wednesday. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, saying he only paid settlements to put controversies to rest “to spare” his children.“It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims,” Mr. O’Reilly said in a statement. “But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today. I will always look back on my time at Fox with great pride in the unprecedented success we achieved and with my deepest gratitude to all my dedicated viewers.”To plug the huge hole in the network’s prime-time lineup, Fox News announced it is moving Tucker Carlson up one hour into Mr. O’Reilly’s 8 p.m. time slot and putting “The Five” on at 9 p.m., starting Monday.21st Century Fox Co-Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Co-Chairman Lachlan and Chief Executive James, praised Mr. O’Reilly as “one of the most accomplished TV personalities in the history of cable news” and expressed confidence that the network will continue to be a powerhouse. “Lastly, and most importantly, we want to underscore our consistent commitment to fostering a work environment built on the values of trust and respect,” the Murdochs wrote in the memo. 21st Century Fox and News Corp , parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership. Mr. O’Reilly, 67 years old, had recently renewed his contract with Fox News at a salary of more than $20 million annually, people familiar with the matter said.The new four-year contract contained language that gave the company the ability to remove Mr. O’Reilly should any red flags or additional harassment complaints emerge, the people said. That turned out to be the case after the law firm Paul Weiss was brought in to look into some of the allegations against Mr. O’Reilly, they said. The pendulum swung against fighting for Mr. O’Reilly in the past few days as the law firm began disclosing its findings to 21st Century Fox management, a person close to the situation said.On Wednesday morning, 21st Century Fox General Counsel Gerson Zweifach met with Mr. O’Reilly’s lead attorney Frederic Newman to inform him of the company’s decision. Negotiations over Mr. O’Reilly’s exit package aren’t completed but aren’t expected to be acrimonious, a person close to him said. Fox News and 21st Century Fox initially seemed willing to weather the storm, even as longtime foes of Mr. O’Reilly and the channel, and activists, seized on the scandal as an opportunity to demand his exit. “The O’Reilly Factor” averaged about four million viewers a night, making it one of the highest rated programs in all of cable television.But inside 21st Century Fox debate grew about whether holding on to Mr. O’Reilly and his ratings was worth the trade-off. Advertisers were withdrawing from his show, and concerns were growing about the message the company was sending by defending Mr. O’Reilly. Mr. O’Reilly’s show had been the anchor of the evening, and his ratings power had boosted viewership for the shows that followed him. To many, he was the face of the network, and it remains to be seen what he may do next, though speculation ranges from syndicated TV show to a radio broadcast or streaming service.“He is what people think of when they think of Fox News,” said Andrew Tyndall, a television news consultant. If Mr. O’Reilly “goes somewhere else, that could be a real threat to Fox News,” he said.Mr. O’Reilly also has a lucrative book career to fall back on.Henry Holt & Co., an imprint owned by Macmillan Publishers that publishes Mr. O’Reilly’s books, said its “plans have not changed” regarding future titles written either by Mr. O’Reilly or with his cooperation. More than 17 million copies of Mr. O’Reilly’s books published by Holt are in print in all formats, and his latest title “Old School” is No. 1 on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction best-sellers list.Mr. O’Reilly’s departure may bring the old-school era at Fox News to an end. Last year, Fox News Chief Executive Mr. Ailes resigned after he was accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and an internal investigation revealed a pattern of inappropriate behavior toward female staffers. Mr. Ailes denied all of the accusations, and he walked with an exit package worth more than $40 million, a person familiar with the matter said at the time.21st Century Fox said in a November Securities and Exchange filing that it has paid $35 million in settlements and claims against Mr. Ailes. That includes a $20 million settlement for former on-air personality Gretchen Carlson.After Mr. Ailes’s departure, Rupert Murdoch took over as chief executive of Fox News, and his sons pledged their commitment “to maintaining a work environment based on trust and respect.”That statement last year from James and Lachlan Murdoch drew additional scrutiny to their handling of the O’Reilly matter.Even with Mr. O’Reilly’s exit, 21st Century Fox can’t fully move past the broader issue of sexual harassment and the scrutiny over how women have been treated at the company. Federal prosecutors are currently investigating whether the company made insufficient disclosures about settlements of harassment claims, people familiar with the matter have said. The company has said it is cooperating with the investigation.Meanwhile, 21st Century Fox is also trying to win U.K. regulatory approval for its acquisition of the rest of British TV giant Sky PLC that it doesn’t already own. Critics of the deal have used the sexual-harassment scandal at Fox News as a reason to urge regulators to scrutinize the company’s corporate culture and whether it is a fit owner.With the departures of Mr. Ailes and Mr. O’Reilly in less than a year, Fox News has lost both its maestro and its lead performer. Mr. O’Reilly perfectly executed Mr. Ailes’s vision for Fox News as a channel for those who saw themselves as a silent majority not being served by other news platforms.“Bill O’Reilly’s legacy is Fox News,” said Jon Klein, a former president of rival CNN. “He not only put Fox News on the map but he became the public face of a movement.” Losing him, he added, is like “losing a support beam from your house.” —Jeffrey A.

Dobriansky and Aaron Lobel Only 36 percent of Americans approve of the way President Donald Trump is handling his job as president. | Getty By Steven Shepard03/27/17 01:18 PM EDTPresident Donald Trump’s approval rating slipped to a new low Monday in the Gallup daily tracking poll, the first measure of Trump’s job performance following his administration’s failure to move a new health care law through Congress.Only 36 percent of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president in interviews conducted last Friday through Sunday, a time period entirely after Republicans abandoned their bill to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Story Continued BelowTrump’s approval rating is down from 41 percent in the prior three-day period. His previous low-water mark in the Gallup poll came earlier this month, when interviews conducted March 16-18 showed his approval rating at just 37 percent.In the new survey, the percentage of Americans who disapprove of Trump’s performance is 57 percent, up from 54 percent in the previous three-day rolling sample. That’s one point shy of Trump’s highest disapproval rating: 58 percent in the March 16-18 sample.Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

George W. Bush’s lowest-ever rating was 25 percent, George H.W. Bush’s was 29 percent and Ronald Reagan’s was 35 percent.Clinton’s 37-percent score came only about six months into his presidency, in June 1993. But Newport notes that Clinton’s approval rating recovered over his first summer in the White House, to 56 percent in September 1993 — when he presented his ultimately failed plan to overhaul the health care system.Gallup surveys approximately 1,500 adults over the course of each three-day rolling sample.

      "text" : "For our first-ever Love issue, we asked four authors to recount times when love and travel intersected in their lives: Alexander Chee writes about a possible betrayal in Spain. Jami Attenberg recalls how a friendship deepened in Sicily. Sarah Hepola remembers a road — an an uncertain future — in Mexico (below). And Sloane Crosley looks back at a relationship that took three trips to kill. We also have six writers recounting transformative moments that happened while traveling; a roundup of new hotels and resorts for all kinds of relationships, and a collection of readers’ stories of loves found and lost on the road.My boyfriend and I had been dating for two years when we took the trip to Mexico. We were both 30, so people grew suspicious. “See you in January, when you have a ring,” said a friend, who had gotten married the previous year. The ages of 28 to 30 were like a game of falling dominoes among our circle, but my eyes were tracking other competitions. I could name all of the writers who published successful books before 30, and I could rattle off the parts of the world I had yet to visit, but marriage was still a distant prospect to me, like planning dinner before you’ve eaten lunch.I actually had a dream once that my boyfriend and I went to his sister’s wedding, but it turned out to be our wedding, and I woke up slick with sweat and panicking. I wasn’t certain he was right for me, but I did like the idea of being right for him. Cynics are often romantics in disguise, and my married friend’s joke was enough to release certain fantasies into the air. My boyfriend spinning me around on a deserted beach. Dinner by candlelight, a box creaked open like an oyster shell: Will you?We began our 10-day vacation in Mexico City, a sprawling metropolis of untapped beauty, where we promptly went to the bar. The tequila came in tall glasses that resembled test tubes, and the custom was to sip the liquor and savor the nuance. Until then, tequila had been the kind of bad idea someone pulled off a shelf at 1 a.m., and we used other verbs to describe what happened next: Slam, guzzle, shoot. But slowing down felt adult, sophisticated. My boyfriend announced that when we returned to Dallas, he wanted to open a bar called Correct, where all of the liquor would be served according to its origin country. Chilled Russian vodka, German beer never served ice-cold. He was an M.B.A. student who liked to brainstorm concepts for bars, which suggests how often we were sitting in one.Bars were our safe havens. I always felt connected to him when we were nuzzled in those vinyl booths, under dim lighting, maybe because we could literally see eye to eye. He was tall and lanky, while I was short and curvy, and sometimes I caught a glimpse of us while we were walking, and we looked like mismatched glassware, a champagne flute with a snifter. A bar dissolved the differences between us, though. A bar always felt like being held.We flew to a small village on the Pacific Coast called Mazunte. The weather was an immaculate 80 degrees. We ate lunch at a beach grill that served fish tacos, and I nudged my bare feet into the sand, making tiny mountains with my toes, and then we headed toward the shore, the nervous part where we had to reveal ourselves.He was the first in the water. I sat on a towel and watched him splash around like a little boy. “It feels amazing,” he assured me, and I waited until strangers had stopped passing, and then I took off my top and the little gingham skirt that hid the heartbreaking part of my thighs, and I hustled out in my one-piece fast enough that maybe nobody saw me. Whenever I allowed myself to return to water, I was overwhelmed by how much I had missed it. Out on dry land, I felt hollow in some indescribable way, but the water connected me to something larger than myself. As the waves gently rocked me and I stared up at the open sky, I wondered why my soul had felt so half-empty before, why I kept frantically trying to fill it.My boyfriend and I became playful that afternoon, which was rare for us. We usually got that way only after a night of drinking. I kept leaping on his back, and he would cart me around, diving into the waves as I squealed with delight. I called him my tortuga, because the area was known for its sea turtles. “Tortuga! Mi tortuga!” I would howl into the wind. And I thought: A person would be lucky to spend a life with this man. It was my goal back then — to appreciate what I already had.That night, we got lost on the way to dinner. We ended up on some stone pathway that climbed into a leafy terrain, following signs that were definitely not for the place we read about in the guidebook. I was starting to get snippy when we popped out into the most intimate restaurant on an oceanside cliff. The whole place felt like a secret. We were greeted by a good-looking man whose native language was Spanish, though he spoke to us in a chummy English. He explained that he owned the place with his Swiss wife, and he gestured inside to a thin, casually elegant blonde before returning to his cocktail and his paperback.“That guy has the life,” my boyfriend said, staring at the pretty Swiss woman as she glided around the interior, and I agreed, but I had that sinking feeling I got whenever his eyes settled too long on another woman, like I was the floppy puppy dragged out of a carnival by the kid who had his heart set on the lion.I was drunk by the time we got back to our hotel. The ocean was empty, dark and churning, and I remembered the voluptuous sensation of the waves from earlier that afternoon. I stripped off my clothes and ran naked toward the ocean.“You’re crazy,” he said, but I thought I had finally gotten it right. I liked the midnight version of myself, the one who wasn’t so flinching and scared, the one who sprinted straight into the open mouth of adventure.“Come on.” I waved him toward me.He unbuckled his jeans with a look of grim resignation and folded them on the sand. “I have no idea what the hell is in this water,” he said, his pale skin glowing as he marched toward me. I kissed him for his sportsmanship, and I leapt on his back again. “Tortuga! Mi tortuga!” I yelled, but he wasn’t laughing this time. He was scanning the dark waters with a pained look on his face. It’s strange how one person’s paradise can be another person’s nightmare. Eventually, we walked back onto the shore, and we made out while lying on the wet sand, the tide crashed up against us like we were in a freaking romance novel. But afterward, I still felt pouty that he hadn’t played my game. Drunk me was rarely happy with the things she had. Drunk me liked to rummage around the cabinets looking for more.Our last stop was Oaxaca City. We took a winding overnight bus and arrived bleary-eyed to a quaint hotel door still locked at 8 a.m. The bus had been my idea, but it was much worse than I had anticipated, and I felt guilty. In my mid-20s, I had traveled alone through South America, and I had suffered such a pinch of loneliness, but now I worried about him. Was he having fun? Had I made the right choices? Sometimes I thought this travel was just me trying to outrun my unhappiness. Maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea to stay still for a while.On New Year’s Eve, we had dinner at the finest hotel in the city, which had been recommended by a restaurateur who loved it so much she held her wedding there. I could get married here, I thought, as we walked through the white corridor and into a courtyard in full bloom. The dinner was on a rooftop offering a romantic view of the colonial city, and each table had a warm amber candle, and I grew jumpier as the courses unfolded, as ceviche gave way to squash blossoms gave way to mole. I was not really a diamond ring kind of woman, but I promised myself if he had one, I would be happy. He reached down to pick up something from the floor at one point, and my heart went sideways, but it was just his napkin. Dessert came and went. We ordered a second bottle of wine, or maybe our third, and I slumped back into the realization that there would be no ring, there would be no proposal. At 12 o’clock, the old year tipped into a new year — and we stayed the same.I returned to Dallas with no ring. I met my friend at the bar, and he regretted the joke he had made before we left. “He should have asked you to marry him,” he said, and I thanked him. More than anything, I wanted to be a woman that a man wanted to marry. It was less a wish to move forward and more a fear of being left behind.I still wonder what would have happened if he and I had continued. It wouldn’t have been so hard. Maybe I never would have stopped drinking, which is what I needed to do to finally write my book. Maybe he never would have found the thin, casually elegant blonde he married and with whom he is now raising a child. That alternate life will remain a mystery, because one evening, a few months after we returned, he turned to me and said the words that will change the course of your life: “I can’t do this anymore.” And the way he said it, I could tell: He was certain.He had given me the gift I needed. We could finally set each other free.",

May this week bring more “Temba, his arms wide” and less “Shaka, when the walls fell.” Let us together be as Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. Q. Is it cheating?: My wife of five years and I have a wonderful marriage, and I am madly in love with her. The one problem is that I have a particular fetish that she is not aware of and I can’t indulge with her: I like to masturbate with other men. No touching, no kissing, just masturbating together either in person or via webcam. This is completely independent from our sex life, which is satisfactory, if vanilla. I don’t do it often, and when I do, I don’t give any identifying information or invite anyone to our home. I internally justify it by telling myself that it’s not something I can do with her anyway, and masturbating by myself isn’t cheating, so why does it matter if someone else is there? This is crazy, isn’t it? I either need to tell her and hope for her unlikely blessing or knock it out and keep it as a fantasy like any other person in a committed, monogamous relationship, right? A: I think you know this is a form of cheating, which is why you’re writing to me. This isn’t an issue of what porn you watch or what fantasies get you off—it’s about sharing a particular form of sex and intimacy with people who aren’t your wife without her knowledge, and it’s a betrayal of the monogamous commitment she believes you two have. What you want—a mostly monogamous relationship with a woman and periodic jerk-off sessions with other men—isn’t “crazy.” The hiding and the lying are what’s wrong, not the desire itself. Had you brought this desire up sooner in your relationship, she might have happily indulged your relatively low-risk interest. Or she might have found it unacceptable. Either way, she has the right to make that decision for herself. The desire by itself is perfectly understandable, and many people would be open-minded or even enthusiastic about the arrangement you’ve described. But you ought to tell your wife and accept whatever fallout your revelation brings. If you two can eventually find your way to a similar arrangement again someday with your wife’s full knowledge, forgiveness, and blessing, so much the better; if not, you should be honest with future partners about what you want before you start doing it. Q. To date or not to date?: I am a 38-year-old single professional woman who was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer and will be starting chemo soon. My previous boyfriend and I broke up last October (we dated for six months), and I would like to start dating again. I feel that because I will be going through this sickness, it wouldn’t be fair to involve a man that I’m just getting to know in all of this, but I would also hate to put this part of my life on hold for however long this goes on. Even though I’m sick, I feel good and want to live my life. If I do decide to date someone, should I bring up my situation early in conversation or before the first date or wait until the second or third? Advertisement A: There’s no strict rule of etiquette here, although I wish I could give you a really clear maxim like, “Tell everyone on the third date after drinks but before dinner.” You’re not asking these guys to accompany you to chemo treatments; you’re trying to have a normal dating life while managing your cancer. It may be that some guys decide to bail whether you bring it up right away or wait until the second or third date to say something. That most likely cannot be helped. You have no moral obligation to disclose, so be guided only by your sense of when you feel ready, whether that’s right away or after you’ve already been out on one or two dates. Q. Should I tell my friend about her husband’s pot habit?: My best childhood friend married a boy she met through me in high school. I am closer to her but friends with both. He smokes pot. I knew he was hiding it and told him if she asked me outright I wouldn’t lie, but I didn’t see it as my place to “tattle” on him, and I don’t personally think it’s a big deal. I still don’t, except she got busted spending a lot more on a craft hobby than they agreed upon. Since his discovery, he’s finagled a motorcycle and various things out of her guilt. He lost a job a few years ago due to a failed drug test and lied to her about the reason, and was still spending $60–80 a week on pot while unemployed while she was working overtime to make up for it. I’m uncomfortable with it but still didn’t see it as my place to get involved. I found out recently that he’s using her “dishonesty about finances” to accuse her of having an affair. She’s clearly feeling guilty about it, and it’s really bothering me that he’s throwing something in her face when he’s been doing the same thing for years. To clarify: I know for a fact she’s not cheating, and yes, I know for a fact she’s unaware of his habit. Should I tell her? A: I think in the future you should involve yourself less in your friends’ unhappy marriage. They’ve both been dishonest and suspicious of one another, and made a habit out of keeping weird hobby-related secrets from one another, and the only way they can rebuild trust (or decide that’s not possible and separate) is together. That said, the information he’s keeping from her—that he was fired for failing a drug test—has negatively affected her financial security and is presumably something you yourself would want to know, were you in her situation. You never asked her husband to share this secret with you, and he knew the risk he was running by telling you and not his wife. If you do tell her, and I’m inclined to think you should, bear in mind that their marriage has plenty of problems beside this one, and that whatever they decide to do, you should keep your distance. If either of them attempts to take you into their confidence about something they should instead be telling one another, say exactly that: “Please tell your husband/wife this instead of me. I’m not the person who needs to know this information.” Dear Prudie: My religion is opposed to homosexuality, but I haven’t told my queer friends I disapprove of their lifestyles. requirejs([ 'premium-panoply', 'css!../css/components/premium-panoply' ], function (premiumPanoply) ); Advertisement Hear more Prudence at Slate.com/Prudiepod. Q. Screamingly bad example: My mother-in-law is a screamer in two ways: Her habitual volume is loud, and she often viciously yells and screams in anger at her adult children. The former is annoying but not anything I would ever address with her. The latter I’ve always considered to be between her and her children, and I’m not sure any of them consciously hear it for what it is anyway. But now we have a child who’s learning to talk. I’m not OK with the example his grandmother is setting. How do we teach him not to yell and scream to get his way when his grandmother does exactly that? How do we convey that it’s not OK to treat people as he will see his grandmother treating his father and uncles? Or, on the flip side, how do we get her not to do that in front of him when she would likely scream at my husband for the disrespect of asking her to tone it down? I have a feeling we’re going to need to address both sides of this—what to say to our son and what to say to my mother-in-law—and I’m at a loss on both. A: If you believe your mother-in-law would scream at her own child for asking her not to scream at her own grandchild, then this is a conversation that’s long overdue. Because you’ve turned a blind eye to her bad behavior in the past, it may feel more than a little uncomfortable to draw a line now, but the conversations you’re about to have are, fortunately, pretty simple: “Grandma, we love you and we want you to get to spend time with Grandson, but we can’t allow you to yell or scream at him, or at other adults who might be with him. He’s a little child, and we want him to feel safe and loved, as well as to teach him how to use his words appropriately when he’s upset.” If she responds to this reasonable request by screaming and yelling, stay calm and tell her you’ll be happy to schedule some grandma-grandson time when she’s able to speak rationally. Then end the conversation and do exactly that. You’re getting the opportunity to parent upward as well as downward. Treat her tantrums the same way you would your son’s. You don’t have to argue with her about it. This isn’t a conversation. This a hard limit—she needs to be able to treat your child with basic civility and respect, otherwise she won’t be able to spend time with him. If she agrees to your terms, let her know that you’ll give her a warning when she starts to raise her voice or lash out, and if she can’t bring herself under control, you’ll end the interaction. This will feel difficult, especially since you haven’t set limits with her before, but it’s your only bargaining chip. Either she’ll seek help in altering her behavior or she’ll see a lot less of her grandson. Advertisement As for your son, tell him that it’s not OK to scream at people and that even some adults—like his grandmother—have a difficult time behaving appropriately. He’ll learn this lesson best by watching what you do as well as what you say. If you back down and let his grandmother go on her tirades unchecked, he’ll instead learn that people who are willing to yell and scream and wear down the people around them always ending up getting what they want. Q. Love is in the air: My fiancé and I used to have a solemn pact not to pass gas in front of each other to keep the romance alive. A distressing encounter with a very bean-and-cheese heavy meal ruptured that peace. It is now a farting free-for-all. I don’t mind, because (1) farts are hilarious, (2) a lifetime of holding it in is not sustainable, and (3) farts are hilarious. My fiancé has made a half-hearted plea to return to our prior modest ways. Do I have to try? Or do I wait until it’s a real ask to modify my ways? Not that it matters, but we are two dudes, thus eliminating the gender-based dynamic that might emerge around making wind. A: Your partner has made a half-hearted plea, so make a half-hearted attempt. There’s a balance to be struck between a lifetime of repression and living out that campfire scene from Blazing Saddles; attempt to find it. Q. Re: Screamingly bad example: One thought—does she need her hearing checked? Advertisement A: It doesn’t sound like her customary high volume is the problem, but the fact that she regularly screams in anger at her adult children. Whether or not she’s hard of hearing, the real issue is how she expresses anger. It might be worth encouraging her to get it checked out, of course, but that won’t address the most pressing problem. Subscribe to Prudie! Q. Wedding etiquette: My husband has been invited to two separate weddings recently. The first wedding was casual and informal, and the second is a formal and destination affair. I was not invited to either. The first wedding he has already attended without me and only told me he was going to the wedding the morning of. The second wedding the invitation only has his name on it. I met both couples through my husband, and he socializes with them a lot more than I do. I am pretty friendly with the first wedding couple, but I do not know the second wedding couple very well. Is it normal to invite one spouse and not the other? Even if I could not attend either wedding (which they are not aware of), I find it odd not to extend an invitation. Am I wrong? Is my husband wrong to accept an invite without me? I want to bring it up to him, but if this is some new normal wedding etiquette, I will let it be. A: It’s not normal! Generally speaking, guests with spouses or long-term partners are always invited as a couple. Your husband can, if he’s close with the couple, say, “I got an invitation but noticed my wife’s name was left off, so I wanted to check in with you before RSVPing.” Then you two can decide what you’d prefer. Some people are offended at the idea of being invited to a wedding without their partner, and others don’t mind in the least, especially if the partner in question isn’t friends with the bride and groom. If you’d rather he not go without you, feel free to tell him about your discomfort. Q. Follow-up to a recent column: You responded to my question a while ago about how to deal with a grandmother who knows I’m gay but won’t stop asking when I’m going to find a girlfriend and get married. I wanted to follow up and let you know that I took your advice; she inevitably asked again, but this time, instead of giving her an excuse, I told her I was gay and wouldn’t be finding a girlfriend any time soon. She got upset, but she didn’t die, and the world didn’t end either. I feel better having spoken up for myself, and hopefully this’ll put an end to all the questions. Thank you for your advice! Advertisement Q. Hugging woes: I don’t like being hugged, and it’s only getting worse as I get older. Problem is, seemingly everyone is a hugger. For politeness’ sake, I usually just swallow my discomfort and allow it, but I am an adult and am starting to feel like there’s no time like the present to start getting to decide what is and isn’t done with my body. Trouble is, how do I communicate this in a way that doesn’t make the hugger feel bad? Especially if I have allowed it in the past? Especially (ugh, ugh) with relatives that have hugged me since I was a child? Should I just suck it up? Top Comment Weddings: \"The first wedding he has already attended...and only told me he was going to the wedding the morning of. \" Ok, who the f--- does this? More... Join In A: If it’s someone you don’t know well, feel free to say, “I’m not a hugger,” and offer a friendly handshake. If you want to change protocol with someone you know and care for, you can offer a bit more context. Say, “I feel a little vulnerable bringing this up, because I haven’t mentioned it before, but I really don’t like hugging, and I’d much prefer to shake hands [or whatever other gesture you like] when we see one another. Please know that I love getting to see you, and you haven’t done anything wrong, but I just don’t like hugging and I’d much rather not do it. I appreciate your bearing with me.” It’s a perfectly appropriate request, and hopefully the people who care about you will be more than happy to adapt. The point of hugging ought to be making the huggee feel welcomed, cared-for, and comfortable, not just mashing your torsos together. Even the most pro-hugging person alive should (hopefully!) not want to hug someone if it means making them feel tense and uncomfortable. Discuss this column with Dear Prudence on her Facebook page!

      "text" : "During a joint news conference with North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, April 12, President Trump said NATO is \"no longer obsolete.\" (The Washington Post) President Trump on Wednesday pledged his full support to NATO, reaffirming the United States' commitment to the alliance and saying he no longer considers it “obsolete,” a sharp reversal from his rhetoric on the campaign trail and during his first weeks in office. On a day when Trump dramatically changed his stance on several policy positions, his statement about NATO stood out given his consistent criticism of the military alliance and its importance to U.S. allies. For more than a year, Trump has said NATO is outdated and costing the United States too much money, suggesting replacing it with an alternative organization focused on counterterrorism and repeatedly using the word “obsolete.” As recently as January, Trump continued to stand by this position — which alarmed many NATO members — saying in a Jan. 15 interview with the Times of London and Germany’s Bild that NATO is “obsolete because it wasn’t taking care of terror” and that critics of his comments have “started saying Trump is right.” During a joint news conference Wednesday afternoon with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump professed that his criticisms prompted the alliance to make changes that satisfied his concerns--though he did not specify what those were. “I complained about that a long time ago, and they made a change — and now they do fight terrorism,” Trump said. “I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete.” It's unclear what changes the president was referencing. NATO added a new assistant secretary general position focused on intelligence and security in July, although experts say the change does not mark a major shift for the organization and point out that NATO has long addressed concerns of terrorism. For months after the position was created, Trump continued to call NATO obsolete. Stoltenberg told the president he was “right,” but described the change in far different terms. “We have established a new division for intelligence, which enhances our ability to fight terrorism, and working together in the alliance to fight terrorism in an even more effective way,” Stoltenberg said. “But we agreed today, you and I, that NATO can and must do more in the global fight against terrorism.” Despite his campaign rhetoric, Trump and his aides have steadily offered support for NATO since he took office. The president has committed to attending a meeting of the NATO countries on May 25 in Brussels during his first foreign trip, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attended meetings of the alliance in late March. In brief remarks, Trump again called on NATO members to “meet their financial obligations and pay what they owe,” noting that member-nations are expected to contribute 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense. Stoltenberg confirmed that ensuring the cost burden is better shared among countries has become a top priority for him. politics post-politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Later, Trump said he asked Stoltenberg to look into collecting back-dues from countries, something that Stoltenberg did not verbally agree to do. Trump has consistently misrepresented the financial obligations of NATO members, saying they “owe vast sums” in dues and the situation is unfair to the United States. NATO members do not owe dues or back payments. Trump also thanked NATO members for condemning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons and “the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies.” At one point, Trump referred to the Syrian leader as a “butcher.” On Wednesday, Trump backed away from several other firm positions that he had held for months on the campaign trail. Early in the day, the government ended a federal government hiring freeze that Trump had promised to institute, although departments have been told to find other ways to shrink staff sizes. Then, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the president announced he no longer considers China a currency manipulator, he now supports lower interest rates and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and he would consider renominating Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen when her tenure is up next year, despite saying on the campaign trail he would “most likely” not reappoint her. Last week, Trump abandoned his longtime stance that the United States should not get involved with Syria when he approved a strike on an airbase there. “I felt we had to do something about it,” Trump said Wednesday of the Syria bombing. “I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing. And it was very, very successfully done, as you well know.”",

      "text" : "The message was defiantly optimistic, like a suitor determined to hold a relationship together despite mounting obstacles. “Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia,” ­President Trump declared on his Twitter account last week. “At the right time everyone will come to their senses & there will be lasting peace!” Trump’s interest in achieving warm relations with Moscow has been a consistent theme since the earliest days of his campaign, and it stands now as one of the few major foreign policy positions that he has not discarded or revised since taking office. But in his devotion to this outcome, Trump appears increasingly isolated within his own administration. Over the past several weeks, senior members of Trump’s national security team have issued blistering critiques of Moscow, using harsh terms that have led to escalating tensions between the countries and seem at odds with the president. The harsh rhetoric — and the apparent lack of any rebuke from Trump — suggests that Russian skeptics have gained influence in the administration, making the rapprochement that Trump envisioned seem increasingly remote. In a speech at the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley lashed out at Russia for its role in Syria, asking “how many more children have to die before Russia cares” enough to prevent Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from committing further atrocities. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accused Russia of being “incompetent or complicit” in the chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of Syrian civilians. CIA Director Mike Pompeo went even further in an appearance at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington last week, depicting Moscow as an unredeemable adversary. Though Trump has repeatedly praised Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, Pompeo described him as “a man for whom veracity doesn’t translate into English.” The statements have created confusion about the Trump administration’s posture toward Russia and have put senior officials, including Haley, in the awkward position of having to explain why Trump has yet to echo any of their harsh words. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Foreign policy experts close to the administration played down the apparent disconnect between Trump’s statements and those of his national security subordinates, saying that Trump’s words about Russia were often misinterpreted to signal he intended to be soft. “There was never anything in the plan about being nice to the Russians,” said James Carafano, the vice president of foreign and defense policy at the Heritage Foundation, who served as an adviser to Trump during the campaign and post-election transition. “I don’t think any of this is a U-turn, a reversal or a shift,” Carafano said. He noted that Trump’s decision to bomb an airstrip in Syria where the Russian military had worked with Assad’s forces and Trump’s recent vocal support for NATO demonstrate his willingness to defy Putin. “Trump doesn’t have to do Russia bashing” and is probably seeking to leave an opening for Putin to pursue better relations with the United States, Carafano said. “The fact that [Trump’s officials] are not mimicking the exact same words doesn’t mean they’re not on the same sheet of music.” In recent weeks, Trump has had opportunities to reinforce the messages of his subordinates. In a news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg this month, Trump said relations with Moscow “may be at an all-time low” but described Russia as “a strong country” and said, “We’re going to see how that all works out.” Asked about mounting concerns in Europe over alleged Moscow interference in elections and calls for bolstering Europe’s military defenses, Trump had no words of caution for the Kremlin. “Right now there is a fear, and there are problems,” he said. “But ultimately, I hope that there won’t be a fear and there won’t be problems and the world can get along. That would be the ideal situation.” Trump’s tack with Russia seems at odds with his approach toward other global powers and issues. He threatened to label China a currency manipulator and to cut off U.S. support for NATO, for example, before retreating from those positions in recent weeks. His posture toward Moscow is also seen as a reflection of Trump’s reluctance to acknowledge that Russia interfered in the U.S. election and, based on the consensus view of U.S. intelligence agencies, sought to help him win. Critics said the administration’s competing messages have caused concern overseas. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that he recently attended a security conference in Munich where there were “profound questions among our allies about just where this administration is coming from.” “They don’t see the president yet willing to take on Putin or to criticize him directly,” Schiff said. “It doesn’t mater what others in his Cabinet said. If they didn’t hear it from the president, they didn’t really believe it was administration policy.” Senior administration officials have struggled to explain the disparity between their comments — including statements suggesting that Russia may have known that Assad was about to launch a chemical weapons attack — and those of the president. “I think we’re both saying the same thing, it’s just being reported differently,” Haley said during an interview on ABC News this month. Pressed on why Trump has not condemned Moscow, Haley said, “This is what I can tell you: The president has not once called me and said, ‘Don’t beat up on Russia,’ has not once called me and told me what to say.” Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, faced similar questions in a separate ABC interview this week when asked how the president could be so confident that “things will work out fine” and predict “lasting peace.” “Well,” McMaster quipped, “when relations are at the lowest point, there’s nowhere to go but up.” McMaster has helped form the administration’s more combative stance toward Moscow. He replaced Michael Flynn, who seemed to share Trump’s interest in pursuing closer relations with Moscow before Flynn was fired for his misleading statements about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. world national-security Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

See all newsletters Juan Zarate, a former national security official who advised Pompeo during his confirmation as CIA chief, said that he sees Trump’s continued conciliatory messages toward Moscow as a means of preserving options for the administration in its dealings with Russia. “I worry less about what appears to be some discordance because I think you can have flexibility in messaging,” Zarate said. “But you do have to have consistency in policy. For now it seems like we do. In fact the policy seems to be getting more vigorous and confrontational.” But Zarate also noted Trump’s tendency to “double down on positions.” Trump was criticized for seeming lenient toward Moscow, “and lo and behold he’s going to stick to his line.” Moscow has also noticed the administration’s competing messages. After a series of sharp exchanges with senior U.S. officials, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this week that Moscow would focus on signals from the president. “We will be guided by what President Donald Trump once again confirmed . . . that he wants to improve relations with the Russian Federation,” Lavrov said. “We are also ready for that.”",

      "text" : "When President Trump began receiving his intelligence briefings in January, his team made a request: The president, they said, was a visual and auditory learner. Would the briefers please cut down on the number of words in the daily briefing book and instead use more graphics and pictures? Similarly, after Trump entered office, his staff took President Barack Obama’s Syria contingency plans and broke the intelligence down into more-digestible bites, complete with photos, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the request. This week, it was the images — gruesome photos of a chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians — that moved Trump, pushing the president, who ran on an “America first” platform of nonintervention, to authorize the launch of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syrian targets Thursday night. Senior administration officials and members of Congress who spoke with Trump said the president was especially struck by two images: young, listless children being splashed with water in a frantic attempt to cleanse them of the nerve agent; and an anguished father holding his twin babies, swathed in soft white fabric, poisoned to death. As the carnage unfolded on cable news, which the president watches throughout the day and deep into the night, Trump turned to his senior staff, talking about how “horrible” and “awful” the footage out of Syria was, said one top adviser. Syrian father holds lifeless twins after chemical attack Embed Copy Share Play Video1:15 (Associated Press) The 9-month-old twin children of Abdel Hameed Alyousef were killed along with his wife, two brothers, two nephews and a niece in a suspected chemical attack in the the northwestern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun on April 4. Abdel Hameed Alyousef's 9-month-old twins were killed along with his wife in a suspected chemical attack in the the northwestern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun (Associated Press) “What the world saw last night was the United States commander in chief, and also a father and grandfather,” Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said Friday. “The world recoiled in horror at babies writhing and struggling to live. And who could avert their gaze — and that includes our very tough, very resolute, very decisive president.” Horrific images were not the only reason military action made sense for Trump. Whatever his concern for the people of Syria — a country whose refugees would not be able to enter the United States for 120 days under Trump’s latest travel ban proposal — he has been eager to show a clear victory more than two months into his tumultuous young presidency. A strike against Syria could help him demonstrate independence from Russia and its president, Vladi­mir Putin, whose alleged efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential race have proved a major distraction. And Trump wants to show that he is a tougher and stronger leader than Obama, who received scathing criticism when he drew a “red line” with Syria over its use of chemical weapons and then declined to act when President Bashar al-Assad bounded over it. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Friday questioned Trump’s “24-hour pivot on Syria policy,” noting that until Assad’s regime launched its chemical attack, Trump had not made Syria a priority. White House press secretary Sean Spicer had told reporters last week that the United States had to accept the “political reality” of Assad’s grip on power. “There is no strategy on Syria,” Murphy said. “He clearly made this decision based off an emotional reaction to the images on TV, and it should worry everyone about the quixotic nature of this administration’s foreign policy and their potential disdain for the warmaking authority of the United States Congress.” Throughout the week, Trump’s public remarks placed a special emphasis on the youngest victims. “When you kill innocent children, innocent babies, babies, little babies, with a chemical gas that is so lethal — people were shocked to hear what gas it was,” Trump said Wednesday afternoon in the Rose Garden, where he appeared at a news conference with King Abdullah II of Jordan. “That crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line — many, many lines.” On Thursday, when a subdued Trump addressed the nation, he spoke of “beautiful babies” cruelly murdered, declaring, “No child of God should ever suffer such horror.” Suspected chemical attack kills scores of men, women and children in Syria Embed Copy Share Play Video1:19 (The Washington Post) Doctors and activists in rebel-held areas have blamed the Syrian government for a sharp increase in chemical attacks since the end of last year. Suspected chemical attack kills scores of men, women and children in Syria (The Washington Post) About 54 hours after receiving news of the attacks in his daily briefing Tuesday morning, Trump — by then at his private Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida for a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping — gave the order to target Shayrat air base. At 7:40 p.m. Thursday, as Trump and Xi were midway through a meal of pan-seared Dover sole with champagne sauce and dry-aged prime New York strip steak (a Trump favorite), a naval destroyer launched the first of nearly five dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles, lighting up the sky in eastern Syria. White House aides and Trump deputies said that while the photos clearly affected Trump, he made his final decision after consulting with his advisers in a process they described as deliberative and thorough. Over an intensive 2½ days, the president’s national security team convened several high-level meetings with representatives from the Pentagon, the State Department, intelligence agencies and the National Security Council. “I don’t think it was an emotional reaction at all,” said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was involved in the discussions. “President Trump evaluated the facts, that the attacks occurred on his watch, and [as he] reflected upon prior responses or lack of responses, he came to the conclusion that we cannot yet again turn away, turn a blind eye from what’s happened.” But the process was especially — and perhaps intentionally — quick, in contrast to the style of Obama, who prided himself on making decisions based on information, not emotions, a manner his critics derided as “dithering,” as former vice president Richard B. Cheney put it early in Obama’s first term. Trump learned of the chemical attack Tuesday morning, asked for options on how to respond Wednesday and received them Thursday, the day he authorized the strike. He asked the Defense Department to prepare potential responses after the Pentagon assessed that the Syrian military was responsible for Tuesday’s chemical strike and for chemical attacks March 25 and March 30 against civilians near Hama air base, U.S. military officials said. U.S. Central Command has had plans for striking the Syrian government for years and has significant assets in the region, enabling a quick response once a decision was made. The National Security Council deliberated Wednesday night, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other senior officials discussed the possibilities, senior military officials said. Ultimately, aides presented Trump with three options, but the president narrowed them to two and asked aides to flesh out more details. Senior military and White House officials said Trump selected the “proportional” choice among the options available. Richard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security, where Mattis was recently a member of the board, said the options probably included doing nothing and launching more comprehensive airstrikes involving bombers and jets. “I suspect that they said if you are going to do something, they need to do it quickly,” Fontaine said. “You need to not hand-wring about this for weeks.” Thursday, Trump held another meeting aboard Air Force One as he flew to Palm Beach, Fla. Some officials — including national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon — joined him in the plane’s wood-paneled conference room, with others piped in via secure videoconference from Washington as the presidential jet streaked southward. Once on the ground in Florida, aides said, Trump gave Mattis the order to move forward. The defense secretary passed it along to Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Army Gen. Joseph L. Votel, chief of U.S. Central Command. The missiles were launched about three hours later, at 3:40 a.m. local time, to minimize civilian casualties. In the process, the president — who had championed an “America first” worldview rooted in the belief that U.S. foreign policy had become too interventionist — appeared to swing sharply in the other direction. Thursday’s strike also raised several uncomfortable, still-unanswered questions: Was Trump motivated to attack Syria in part because Obama never did? Was he driven by a need for a political victory, at home and abroad? And what is the administration’s long-term strategy and goal in Syria? It was unclear as well whether Trump fully considered the ramifications of his decision. Russia, whose president has supported Assad and whose troops operate inside Syria, reacted initially with pique, canceling a key air agreement designed to avoid military confrontations with U.S. forces in the skies, before later agreeing to restore the deal. politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters And even as the White House touted support for the decision in Congress and foreign capitals, administration officials acknowledged that the attack, which they described as commensurate with Assad’s violation of “international norms,” would not eliminate his ability to do it again. Though Trump had often seemed to blame Obama for the situation in Syria, his remarks Thursday night from Mar-a-Lago were nonpartisan and intentionally so, a senior adviser said. The president, this adviser added, was sending a message not only to Syria and Russia but also to China, whose president was in Palm Beach for their summit, and to North Korea that Trump and the United States will not “shirk or shrink” from conflict. On Friday, Spicer, the press secretary, initially told reporters at Mar-a-Lago that he would offer an update on Syria in front of the news cameras. But just before he was to begin his briefing, he reversed himself: He wanted images of the president, both from the night before on Syria and the China summit Friday, to carry the day.

      "text" : "Hillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid. The Clintons revealed their recent income as paid speakers and other aspects of their personal finances in disclosure forms filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday Hillary Clinton also earned more than $5 million in royalties for her book, “Hard Choices,” which was released in June. One of her Republican rivals for the presidency, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, also filed his financial information Friday, revealing a far more modest portfolio. It showed that last year he cashed out his retirement accounts, which were worth between $60,000 and $195,000; a campaign spokesman declined to comment on why. Rubio and his wife hold at least $450,000 in home mortgage debt. Clinton has tripped politically in addressing her personal wealth, drawing criticism last year for indicating she and her husband were “dead broke” when his term as president concluded in 2001. Though saddled with debt because of legal fees arising from various White House scandals, Bill Clinton’s memoirs and frenetic speaking schedule quickly lifted the couple into the ranks of the uber-wealthy. [Read more: How the Clintons went from ‘dead broke’ to rich] During the 11 years Hillary Clinton served as a U.S. senator and then secretary of state, she reported that her husband made $105 million for delivering more than 540 speeches. Bill Clinton’s fees rose over time. In 2012, her last year at the State Department, he earned more than $16.3 million for 72 speeches. Until Friday’s financial disclosure filing, there had not been a complete picture of which groups she addressed on the speaking circuit or how much she made. According to the disclosure, Hillary Clinton delivered 51 speeches in 2014 and the first three months of 2015, earning more than $11 million. Her fees varied, but she earned as much as $315,000 for speaking to eBay in San Jose on March 11; she also collected $325,000 for speaking to the technology company Cisco in Las Vegas in August. After she left her post, Hillary Clinton’s huge speaking fees at times attracted criticism. In particular, she charged as much as $300,000 to speak at public universities, though she generally donated the funds to Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Those engagements are not reflected among the new disclosures, since they did not provide Clinton with personal income. Her earnings drew immediate rebuke from Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who termed the haul “staggering” and said it showed how “out-of-touch [the Clintons have] truly become.” The new information covers a period beginning in January 2014 and shows the Clintons were paid about $250,000 every time they spoke. She has not been required to release any details about what she earned in the 2013 calendar year after she leftthe State Department. Now that she is running for president, Hillary Clinton has stopped giving paid speeches. But Bill Clinton said this month that he intends to continue to collect speaking fees, even as his wife campaigns. “I gotta pay our bills,” he told NBC News. According to the disclosure form, Bill Clinton has delivered 53 speeches since January 2014, including engagements this month. Clinton earned $500,000 on Tuesday alone, collecting $250,000 each for lectures at Univision and Apollo Management Holdings. In May 2014, the former president was paid $275,000 to speak to the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies in Toronto. Because the Clintons have kept their money in cash, they had no capital gains last year, a senior campaign official said. The couple liquidated their investments in 2007, during Hillary Clinton’s previous campaign for president, after federal officials deemed a blind trust established during Bill Clinton’s presidency to be out-of-date. [Speech income shows how Clintons’ wealth is intertwined with charity] The couple paid an effective tax rate of more than 30 percent, the campaign official said. They recently moved some of their money into a Vanguard index fund. Rubio’s filing showed no change in his liabilities from 2013 to 2014. He holds three mortgages, including a home equity line of credit. Between the three, Rubio owes at least $450,000 and as much as $1 million. His assets — which include checking and savings accounts, college funds for his children and a rental property in Tallahassee — are worth between $361,018 and $1,035,000. The filing shows his family’s income outside his congressional pay grew in 2014. His wife’s event-planning services firm, JDR Events, which he had indicated in 2013 had earned at least $1,000, did better in 2014, collecting somewhere between $15,001 and $50,000. The New York Times reported this month that the foundation of Florida billionaire Norman Braman had hired Rubio’s wife through JDR Events to advise its charitable efforts. The Times said Braman had declined to discuss her compensation. politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

Rubio reported that in 2014, as in 2013, he was paid $22,115 for the job. Presidential candidates are required to file the financial information with the Federal Election Commission within 30 days of declaring their candidacy. But they can seek up to two 45-day extensions. Republican candidates Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky sought extensions rather than filing Friday. rosalind.helderman@washpost.com anne.gearan@washpost.com Anupama Narayanswamy contributed to this report.",

      "text" : "MOSCOW — I wanted to better understand President Trump’s America, a place where truth is being ripped from its moorings as he brands those tasked with lashing it back into place — journalists — as dishonest enemies of the people.So I went to Russia.It was like a visit to the land of Alternative Truth Yet to Come. But it also gave me a glimpse into how our new national look is playing in the global information war, where competing narratives are clashing along a sliding scale of fact and fiction.I had picked a ghoulishly perfect week to swing through President Vladimir V. Putin’s Moscow, where spring was struggling to break out over the low-slung, slate-gray cityscape.Mr. Trump had just ordered a Tomahawk strike against Syria’s Shayrat air base, from which, the United States said, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria had launched the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 80 and sickened hundreds.As soon as I turned on a television here I wondered if I had arrived through an alt-right wormhole.Back in the States, the prevailing notion in the news was that Mr. Assad had indeed been responsible for the chemical strike. There was some “reportage” from sources like the conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones — best known for suggesting that the Sandy Hook school massacre was staged — that the chemical attack was a “false flag” operation by terrorist rebel groups to goad the United States into attacking Mr. Assad. But that was a view from the fringe.Here in Russia, it was the dominant theme throughout the overwhelmingly state-controlled mainstream media.On the popular Russian television program “Vesti Nedeli,” the host, Dmitry Kiselyov, questioned how Syria could have been responsible for the attack. After all, he said, the Assad government had destroyed all of its chemical weapons. It was the terrorists who possessed them, said Mr. Kiselyov, who also heads Russia’s main state-run international media arm.One of Mr. Kiselyov’s correspondents on the scene mocked “Western propagandists” for believing the Trump line, saying munitions at the air base had “as much to do with chemical weapons as the test tube in the hands of Colin Powell had to do with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.”That teed up Mr. Putin to suggest in nationally televised comments a couple of days later that perhaps the attack was an intentional “provocation” by the rebels to goad the United States into attacking Mr. Assad. RT, the Russian-financed English-language news service, initially translated Mr. Putin as calling it a “false flag.” The full Alex Jones was complete.When Trump administration officials tried to counter Russia’s “false narratives” by releasing to reporters a declassified report detailing Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles — and suggesting to The Associated Press without proof that Russia knew of Mr. Assad’s plans to use chemical weapons in advance — the Russians had a ready answer borrowed from Mr. Trump himself.As the pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia put it, “Apparently it was for good reason Donald Trump called unverified information in the mass media one of the main problems in the U.S.”It was the best evidence I’ve seen of the folly of Mr. Trump’s anti-press approach. You can’t spend more than a year attacking the credibility of the “dishonest media” and then expect to use its journalism as support for your position during an international crisis — at least not with any success.While Mr. Trump and his supporters may think that undermining the news media serves their larger interests, in this great information war it serves Mr. Putin’s interests more. It means playing on his turf, where he excels.Integral to Mr. Putin’s governing style has been a pliant press that makes his government the main arbiter of truth.While talking to the beaten but unbowed members of the real journalism community here, I heard eerie hints of Trumpian proclamations in their war stories.Take Mr. Trump’s implicit threat to the owner of The Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, during the election campaign. In case you’ve forgotten, while calling The Post’s coverage of him “horrible and false,” Mr. Trump warned that if he won the presidency Mr. Bezos’s other business, Amazon, would have “such problems.” (The Post was undaunted, and the issue hasn’t come up again.)The government here doesn’t make threats like that. Things just happen. That was the case last year at the independent media company RBC after its flagship newspaper reported on sensitive financial arrangements of members of Mr. Putin’s family and his associates. The Russian authorities raided the offices of its oligarch owner, Mikhail Prokhorov. Within a few weeks its top three editors had left.The Kremlin denied involvement. But it must have liked the new editor’s message to the RBC staff: Journalism is like driving, and “if you drive over the solid double line they take away your license.”Mr. Prokhorov is considering selling RBC to another oligarch who is closer to the government, the Russian business journal Vedomosti reported on Tuesday.That same day, I met with one of the former RBC editors, Roman Badanin. We chatted at his new place of employment, TV Rain, in the Flacon warehouse complex here, populated by young people with beards, tattoos, piercings and colored hair. (Brooklyn hipster imperialism knows no bounds.)TV Rain has its own hard-luck tale. It was Russia’s only independent television station. Carried mainly on cable, it regularly covered anti-Putin protests and aired voices excluded from the rest of television.But after it ran an online poll asking whether Russia should have abandoned Leningrad to the Nazis to save lives — deeply offending Russian national pride, and receiving a public rebuke from Mr. Putin’s top spokesman — its landlord evicted it and its cable carriers dropped it.It now lives primarily as a subscription service on the internet, which remains fairly free given Mr. Putin’s primary focus on television as the most powerful medium in the country. (Mr. Badanin and others worry that’s going to change, too.)When I asked Mr. Badanin what would be different if Russia had full press freedoms, he looked at me wearily and said: “Everything. Sorry for that common answer, but everything.”Despite steep challenges, people like Mr. Badanin are still battling on. Their journalistic spirit couldn’t be killed, even after some of their friends and colleagues had been.One newspaper here, Novaya Gazeta, has lost five reporters to violence or suspicious circumstances since the turn of the century. Toward the end of the week, I went to its spartan offices in central Moscow to visit its longtime editor, Dmitri Muratov, who has fiercely guarded the paper’s independence through all of the killings and the crackdowns.With the gallows humor of a seasoned journalist, Mr. Muratov was in a jovial mood and told me that he was getting a great kick out of state media’s hard turn against Mr. Trump.Initially, Mr. Muratov said of the president, “he was treated as warmly as McDonald’s; he entered every home like he was our national Santa Claus.” Mr. Muratov had no doubt the sentiment toward Mr. Trump would reverse again, perhaps soon. (To borrow from “1984”: “Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.”)Novaya Gazeta had the toughest coverage on the chemical weapons attack that I saw here, challenging the government narrative with reporting from the ground indicating the chemical weapons were dropped from the air. (The anti-Assad forces do not have airplanes.)There’s a lot of speculation in Russian media circles about why the Kremlin allows Novaya Gazeta to continue to operate.Mr. Muratov says he believes it’s because the newspaper is not owned by a single businessman subject to pressure. The newspaper’s staff owns a majority of the shares, and the rest of them are owned by the former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Russian businessman Alexander Lebedev. (Mr. Lebedev told The Guardian last year that he was no longer financing newsroom operations because of “the strain.”)That, and a loyal subscriber base of more than 240,000, help insulate it from outside pressure, if not the violence.The very day of my visit, Mr. Muratov received a threat against his entire staff from religious leaders in Chechnya, angry over articles about anti-gay violence in the region.The Novaya Gazeta offices are scattered with reminders to take such threats seriously, like the case that holds the dusty desktop computer of Anna Politkovskaya. She was shot dead in her apartment building in 2006 after exposing human rights abuses in Chechnya and writing unflinchingly about Mr. Putin.I wondered aloud whether it scared any of Mr. Muratov’s reporters away from certain stories. He turned serious, looked straight at me and said, “I really wish it could.”Mr. Muratov follows the American news media closely. I asked him what he thought about the American press corps’ quandary when it comes to covering a president, like Mr. Trump, who trades in falsehoods and demonizes journalists.He seemed put off by the question; the answer, to him, was so obvious.“Information from the Kremlin or from the White House, it’s not for us verified information,” he said. “We don’t place our trust just on their word.”It’s a lesson American reporters should have learned long before Mr. Trump came along, especially after Iraq.Journalists in Russia like Mr. Muratov haven’t lost sight of that lesson because they can’t afford to.

      "text" : "Donald J. Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in November came as a shock to the world. Polls, news reports and everything the Clinton campaign was hearing in the final days pointed to her becoming the first female president in American history.In their compelling new book, “Shattered,” the journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes write that Clinton’s loss suddenly made sense of all the reporting they had been doing for a year and a half — reporting that had turned up all sorts of “foreboding signs” that often seemed at odds, in real time, with indications that Clinton was the favorite to win. Although the Clinton campaign was widely covered, and many autopsies have been conducted in the last several months, the blow-by-blow details in “Shattered” — and the observations made here by campaign and Democratic Party insiders — are nothing less than devastating, sure to dismay not just her supporters but also everyone who cares about the outcome and momentous consequences of the election.In fact, the portrait of the Clinton campaign that emerges from these pages is that of a Titanic-like disaster: an epic fail made up of a series of perverse and often avoidable missteps by an out-of-touch candidate and her strife-ridden staff that turned “a winnable race” into “another iceberg-seeking campaign ship.”It’s the story of a wildly dysfunctional and “spirit-crushing” campaign that embraced a flawed strategy (based on flawed data) and that failed, repeatedly, to correct course. A passive-aggressive campaign that neglected to act on warning flares sent up by Democratic operatives on the ground in crucial swing states, and that ignored the advice of the candidate’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, and other Democratic Party elders, who argued that the campaign needed to work harder to persuade undecided and ambivalent voters (like working-class whites and millennials), instead of focusing so insistently on turning out core supporters.“Our failure to reach out to white voters, like literally from the New Hampshire primary on, it never changed,” one campaign official is quoted as saying.There was a perfect storm of other factors, of course, that contributed to Clinton’s loss, including Russian meddling in the election to help elect Trump; the controversial decision by the F.B.I. director, James Comey, to send a letter to Congress about Clinton’s emails less than two weeks before Election Day; and the global wave of populist discontent with the status quo (signaled earlier in the year by the British “Brexit” vote) that helped fuel the rise of both Trump and Bernie Sanders. In a recent interview, Clinton added that she believed “misogyny played a role” in her loss.The authors of “Shattered,” however, write that even some of her close friends and advisers think that Clinton “bears the blame for her defeat,” arguing that her actions before the campaign (setting up a private email server, becoming entangled in the Clinton Foundation, giving speeches to Wall Street banks) “hamstrung her own chances so badly that she couldn’t recover,” ensuring that she could not “cast herself as anything but a lifelong insider when so much of the country had lost faith in its institutions.”Allen and Parnes are the authors of a 2014 book, “H R C,” a largely sympathetic portrait of Clinton’s years as secretary of state, and this book reflects their access to longtime residents of Clinton’s circle. They interviewed more than a hundred sources on background — with the promise that none of the material they gathered would appear before the election — and while it’s clear that some of these people are spinning blame retroactively, many are surprisingly candid about the frustrations they experienced during the campaign.“Shattered” underscores Clinton’s difficulty in articulating a rationale for her campaign (other than that she was not Donald Trump). And it suggests that a tendency to value loyalty over competence resulted in a lumbering, bureaucratic operation in which staff members were reluctant to speak truth to power, and competing tribes sowed “confusion, angst and infighting.”Despite years of post-mortems, the authors observe, Clinton’s management style hadn’t really changed since her 2008 loss of the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama: Her team’s convoluted power structure “encouraged the denizens of Hillaryland to care more about their standing with her, or their future job opportunities, than getting her elected.”The campaign frequently spun its wheels in response to crises and urgent appeals from Democrats on both the state and national levels, the authors report. Big speeches were written by committee. “Evolving the core message” remained a continuing struggle. And the Brooklyn campaign headquarters — which would end up outspending Trump’s campaign by nearly 2 to 1 — frustrated coordinators in battleground states like Colorado by penny-pinching and cutting back on television, direct mail and digital advertising.As described in “Shattered,” Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook — who centered the Clinton operation on data analytics (information about voters, given to him by number crunchers) as opposed to more old-fashioned methods of polling, knocking on doors and trying to persuade undecideds — made one strategic mistake after another, but was kept on by Clinton, despite her own misgivings.“Mook had made the near-fatal mistakes of underestimating Sanders and investing almost nothing early in the back end of the primary calendar,” Parnes and Allen write, and the campaign seemed to learn little from Clinton’s early struggles. For instance, her loss in the Michigan primary in March highlighted the problems that would pursue her in the general election — populism was on the rise in the Rust Belt, and she was not connecting with working-class white voters — and yet it resulted in few palpable adjustments. Michigan, the authors add, also pointed up Mook’s failure to put enough organizers on the ground, and revealed that his data was a little too rosy, “meaning the campaign didn’t know Bernie was ahead.”These problems were not corrected in the race against Trump. Allen and Parnes report that Donna Brazile, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, was worried in early October about the lack of ground forces in major swing states, and that Mook had “declined to use pollsters to track voter preferences in the final three weeks of the campaign,” despite pleas from advisers in crucial states.After a planned appearance in Green Bay with President Obama was postponed, the authors write, Clinton never set foot in Wisconsin, a key state. In fact, they suggest, the campaign tended to take battleground states like Wisconsin and Michigan (the very states that would help hand the presidency to Trump) for granted until it was too late, and instead looked at expanding the electoral map beyond Democratic-held turf and traditional swing states to places like Arizona.In chronicling these missteps, “Shattered” creates a picture of a shockingly inept campaign hobbled by hubris and unforced errors, and haunted by a sense of self-pity and doom, summed up in one Clinton aide’s mantra throughout the campaign: “We’re not allowed to have nice things.”",

Dear Prudence, I graduated college two years ago and spent a year looking for a job in my field. I went to more than 30 interviews, got lots of positive feedback and follow-up interviews, but never a job offer. I’ve done networking events, signed up for mentors, been to job fairs, asked for advice, gone to career counselors, tried staffing agencies and found nothing. I truly am open to critique and tough love if it means I could find my way to success. I’m not even being picky at this point. I’m willing to take anything that requires a college degree and pays a living wage with a chance to move up. The problem is I’ve been working the same reception job full time since graduation and I’m really starting to resent everyone here. I took a year off from trying to find other jobs, and now I’m ready to get back to it. How do I keep my positive face on at work? Job searching stresses me out. I’m unfulfilled, unstimulated, and very unhappy. —Staying Positive Subscribe to Prudie! First, the bad news: This sounds pretty normal for a recent college graduate. The good news is that you are only two years out of college, and this will probably not be the case for the rest of your working life! But going through 30 (or more) sort-of promising interviews without getting a firm offer isn’t unheard of, especially when you’re just starting out and don’t have much experience. Take heart in the fact that your current situation is not unusual or cause for concern. Advertisement That’s all well and good, of course, but it doesn’t do you much good with your current problem, which is how to keep yourself from getting so frustrated with your job search that you can’t do the job you currently have. There’s a few things that might help, particularly limiting the number of hours you spend actively job hunting during the week. This may sound counterintuitive, but one of the most frustrating aspects of the job hunt is the pressure to spend every moment of your spare time on it. Set aside a day or two a week where you don’t comb listings, update your résumé, or go through your contact list for leads, and do something you enjoy after work that’s just for yourself. Once you’ve applied for a job, put it out of your mind and move on to the next opportunity, rather than speculating when they’re going to call back. You might also look within your current company for opportunities to move up or take on new responsibilities that interest you more than working reception; it’s possible you’d find your office less stultifying if you were able to do different kinds of work or shadow someone whose job interests you. Most of what you’re doing—asking for advice from people whose careers you admire, going on follow-up interviews, seeking out mentors—is exactly right; the fact that it hasn’t resulted in a new job yet doesn’t mean you have to completely change tactics. * * * Dear Prudence, My boyfriend and I have been together for two years and I recently came home to find he had moved out while I was at work. I love him with all I am and want to spend the rest of my life with him. For the past six months we have been having problems because his family hates me; they’ve accused me of telling them that my boyfriend is physically and emotionally abusive (he isn’t and I haven’t), have called me a liar, and refused to allow me on their property or in their house to talk and sort things out. I knew that they were angry at me and tried to be understanding and didn’t make him choose sides. I spent so many nights alone at home while he went with his family, even Christmas. His family members were never big fans of mine because when we first got together I was not working due to a back injury from a car accident. But my boyfriend and I have been through a lot together and are happy when it’s just us. He is very sensitive to the feelings of his family and the guilt of feeling like he was hurting them by being with me has been eating him up. He told me that that is why he left. How am I supposed to fix this situation if his family won’t even speak to me and they are endorsing this breakup? Advertisement —Broken and Alone I don’t believe that “fixing” this situation, or getting back together with your ex, should be your goal. As hard as it may be to accept, by your own account your ex-boyfriend has repeatedly chosen to side with his family over you. You say you never asked him to pick sides, but they did, repeatedly, and he’s picked them every time. Presumably he does not believe the lies they have spread about you, but he would rather end your relationship than defend your honesty and integrity to them. The way he ended your relationship was jarring and disorienting, and it will of course take time to deal with the pain of your breakup, but consider that your ex has done you a great favor. It’s telling that he moved out while you were at work without a preliminary conversation; avoidance seems to be a part of his game. If he’s willing to let his family’s lies go unchallenged, to leave you by yourself on major holidays, and break up with you just to keep his parents from criticizing him, then he is not the person whose respect and affection are worth fighting for. * * * Dear Prudence, I am transgender and autistic, and I have made a friend who is also autistic, “Mike.” Mike is cis and straight, while I am gender fluid. This is not an issue for either of us, as we have bonded over our shared social difficulties and many common interests. We’re both enrolled at the local college, and I have been helping Mike stay on top of his schoolwork. But his parents don’t want him to spend time with me. His mother apparently heard from a co-worker that I have “stalking tendencies,” and I have no idea where this came from. I do have social difficulties but have never been accused of stalking. My college has multiple campuses, and I recently learned there is another trans student there who has been accused of stalking; I think it’s likely this is who Mike’s mother has heard about. Advertisement Mike’s parents are highly critical of me and have been trying to convince Mike that I am a bad influence and even tried to ban him from seeing me. Mike is in his early 20s, although he still lives at home. His parents seem to think I am trying to turn their son gay and steal him from them. I’d like to clear up this mistaken identity, but Mike’s parents won’t respond to my request to sit down and have an honest discussion. They are treating Mike so poorly that I fear for his mental health, and all of this is taking a major toll on me. How do I even begin to deal with this? —Friendship Troubles As you say, Mike is an adult and does not need his parents’ permission to be your friend, even if he does live at home. I think you should, for now at least, consider his parents a lost cause. They’re clearly not interested in seeing reason or behaving rationally, but you know that you have done nothing wrong and have nothing to prove. The mistaken identity is a red herring; even if Mike were to correct his parents’ misapprehension, they would find something else to be upset about. Since you’re worried about Mike’s well-being in the face of his parents’ treatment, encourage him to access your campus’ mental health services. Consider visiting a school counselor yourself for support and guidance during this difficult time. You can continue to see Mike at school or out in public, but don’t make yourself responsible for mediating his relationship with his parents. * * * Advertisement Dear Prudie: A guy in my dorm sets an obnoxious alarm for early morning hours and then lets it ring for hours! requirejs([ 'premium-panoply', 'css!../css/components/premium-panoply' ], function (premiumPanoply) ); Hear more Prudence at Slate.com/Prudiepod. Dear Prudence, When I was 12 years old, I testified against my biological dad for years of sexual and physical abuse. His mother, my grandmother, sided with him. Afterward I was adopted and did not speak to any of my biological relatives for 20 years. Eventually I got back into contact with my siblings, and we have developed a good relationship. They told me my grandmother “Marigold” wanted to see me, but I learned that my biological father was about to be released from jail and she was planning on letting him move in with her. I said if she took him in, I would not see her; sure enough, he moved in with her. Since then he’s been back in and out of jail. Now my grandmother is dying and apparently begging to see me. The adult in me feels bad for her, but the child in me wants to know why I was never protected. Why do we automatically forgive the dying? Do I have to see her? I know this sounds coldhearted, but what happened to me all those years ago was never a secret. —Give Her Peace? No, you don’t have to see her. If your grandmother had expressed remorse for her failure to support and protect you as a childhood victim of sexual assault, and if you thought you might gain something by meeting with her and offering your forgiveness, then such a meeting might be worthwhile, but under the present circumstances, I don’t think much good would come out of agreeing to see her. You do not have to forgive someone just because she is nearing death. The mere passage of time is not the same thing as an apology, and she is not offering one now. Without any sign of remorse, it’s likely that what she wants is to justify herself and clear her own conscience for the choices she has made. That your grandmother is dying is sad, certainly, but you do not owe her absolution. The fact that you can pity her at all for her current agitation is a testament to your compassion and kindness. Be gracious to yourself. If you decide not to see her, do not accuse yourself of being cold- or hardhearted; protecting yourself is not the same thing as harming someone else. * * * Dear Prudence, Recently a friend casually remarked that my boyfriend has, in her opinion, made “lots of offensive and sexist comments,” but that she’s able to get past them because she knows he’s a good guy and not a misogynist at heart. I asked her what specifically he had done, and she said, “Oh, lots of things,” and the conversation moved on. Later she sort of apologized but implied that all men are sexist. I agree that there are experiences women have that men never seem to understand, but my boyfriend is a kind person and a self-identified feminist. He’s never said anything in front of me in our three years together that struck me as offensive. Should I ask my friend for clarification? Let it go? Tell my boyfriend so he’s aware he’s coming off as sexist? —Friend vs. Boyfriend There’s no point at present in making your boyfriend aware he might be “coming off as sexist” because, as yet, you have no reason to believe that he does. This is, however, worth revisiting with your friend. Either she has information about your boyfriend’s character that you ought to know about so you can discuss it with him, or she’s making baseless accusations that might lead you to re-evaluate her character. It’s one thing for her to point out that men, as a group, tend to benefit from institutional sexism (although different groups of men experience male privilege in vastly different ways), but it’s quite another to say that your boyfriend specifically has a habit of saying offensive, misogynistic things. That’s worth having a follow-up conversation! It’s possible, although not certain, that your friend was nervous about the prospect of telling you how differently he acts when you’re not around and got conversational cold feet. Ask her to clarify. Say you were thinking about her comments and hoped she could remember anything he’s specifically said or done, because that’s not the impression you have of him and you’d really like to know. If she offers anything specific that you want to then bring up with your boyfriend, you’ll have something to go on. The challenge here is to offer both your friend and your boyfriend, at various points in this process, some benefit of the doubt. Right now you’re trying to collect as many details as possible so you can make an informed decision about what if anything is worth addressing with your boyfriend. A Slate Plus Special Feature: Help! My Girlfriend Wants to Get Married, but I’m Not Ready. Dear Prudence answers more of your questions—only for Slate Plus members. * * * Dear Prudence, I am a freshman in college. About five months ago I was diagnosed with a brain tumor after getting an MRI for a minor head injury. Thankfully, the tumor is very small and likely benign. Nevertheless, it has given me terrible anxiety. I was already a bit of hypochondriac before and now every time I experience any kind of symptom I can’t help but wonder if it’s a sign the tumor is growing. The one thing I have found helpful in countering these thoughts is reminding myself of my upcoming MRI. If the tumor hasn’t grown significantly then I’ll know I was worrying about nothing and if it has grown, I can deal with that then. Recently, my parents (who know me very well) suggested that I push the MRI back a month, so that my inevitable increase in anxiety does not disrupt my already-stressful schoolwork. Medically, this would not be a problem as the tumor is growing very slowly (the neurosurgeon confirmed this), but I am impatient and inclined to go ahead with the scheduled date. I feel that relieving my current, slow-building anxiety sooner is worth the temporary spike that always comes with an MRI. —Anxious Get the MRI! Putting yourself through an additional month of wondering “what if?” every time you get a headache isn’t going to make getting through your schoolwork any easier. Your parents may know you very well, but you know yourself better, and they’re not the ones who have to live with this uncertainty. Whatever the outcome, you’ll at least know what steps you’ll have to take once you get the MRI. Putting it off will only increase your anxiety. Keep your appointment, and good luck.

Ask me your questions on the voicemail of the Dear Prudence podcast. Just leave a message at 401-371-DEAR (3327), and you may hear your question answered on a future episode of the show. Dear Prudence, Aunt “Winifred” came to live with my mother (her sister) and my father under a false pretense. She pleaded poverty and family estrangement, neither of which ended up being true, and now she’s living with our parents without contributing to the household in any real way. She has driven a wedge between my mother and father (Mom acknowledges that this situation isn’t great, but she can’t bring herself to tell Winifred to find somewhere else to live), and it’s taken a toll on all of us, as she drifts malevolently through the house, saying things like: “I wish your father liked me, but I guess I’m too much of a burden.” We’re doing what we can to help relocate her, but in the meantime my mother has had some serious health issues. We are all preparing for the inevitable. My question is this: Can we evict Aunt Winnie when my mother dies? She can manage her own affairs (unlike my 70-year-old parents) but enjoys being taken care of. Is this something we need to address legally? —Can We Evict Her? Subscribe to Prudie! Advertisement Oh yeah, you’re not going to be able to get by on my decidedly not–legally binding advice with this one. You should definitely talk to a lawyer. Depending on which state you live in, your Aunt Winifred may be a legitimate tenant of your parents’ home, even if she’s never signed a lease or paid rent, and she will likely have to be evicted through the appropriate legal channels. It’s almost certainly not going to be as simple as telling Aunt Winifred she has to get her stuff and get out after your mother dies. That said, if you and your father are both in agreement that Aunt Winifred needs to move out relatively soon, and you’re doing everything you can to help her find an affordable place to leave in the meantime, there’s nothing wrong with that. You’re not obligated to host your mother’s sister indefinitely if she’s capable of caring for herself. * * * Dear Prudence, Recently I visited a good friend of mine. As soon as I walked in the door, I was hit with the smell of ammonia from cat urine. Every inch of her house was covered in an animal stench, and my asthma immediately flared up. I said I needed to stay in a hotel for the rest of the trip, saying I’d had to do that because of my asthma before. I didn’t tell her it was because her house smelled horrible. Ever since, I have wondered whether I should tell her because it just seems incredibly unhealthy, not to mention embarrassing for her and her girlfriend. I also wonder about the health of their pets. —Toxic House Advertisement Absolutely you should bring it up. Do it kindly and with compassion, but if she and her girlfriend appear to be unaware that the air in their house is barely breathable, you should bring it to their attention. It’s possible that they’re simply not aware because things have slowly gotten worse, and they’ve grown used to the smell that nearly knocked you out. They (and any other visitors) risk developing bronchitis or pneumonia from breathing in concentrated amounts of ammonia, not to mention developing asthma attacks like the one you experienced. Be tactful but clear: “Thanks again for inviting me to stay with you last week. It was so good to see the both of you. I’m a little embarrassed to bring this up, but I’d want someone to tell me if I were in your position, and sometimes it’s hard to notice something when you live with it every day. My asthma flared up in your house because of the very strong, concentrated smell of cat urine everywhere. I think you need to add more litter boxes and have the house professionally cleaned. I’m worried about the health risks you guys are running by breathing in those ammonia fumes every day.” * * * Dear Prudence, I am transgender and not yet out to my family. My grandmother died at 88 about a month and a half ago. I’d promised myself I wouldn’t put her through my coming out. (I’m nonbinary, which means it’s even more complicated to explain.) But now that she’s gone, and I’ve done my grieving, I’m aching to stop lying and get it out there. I’ve known for more half a decade, but I feel like this is too soon and my remaining relatives will be angry at me for coming out so close to my grandmother’s death. How long should I wait? —Bad Timing Advertisement While death is always sad, the passing of an 88-year-old woman is neither sudden nor shocking, and although everyone grieves differently, it’s been nearly two months. Presumably, all of your relatives have gone back to their own lives and been able to have numerous conversations unrelated to your grandmother’s death. I wouldn’t encourage letter writers to hold off on weddings or job announcements two months after their 88-year-old grandmother died, so I can’t imagine a reason why you should postpone this one. If any of your relatives attempt to use your grandmother’s recent death in order to reproach you, feel free to ignore that transparently distracting tactic. You didn’t interrupt her funeral to make a frivolous announcement—you’re living your life and coming out to your family. People do it every day, and while there may be no time that’s perfectly suited for it, you don’t have to put this conversation off any longer after you’ve been aching to do this for years.

They adore our children and often invite us over. I like them enough to have an occasional coffee with them, but the problem is that two of them are chain-smokers, which makes their house smell like an ashtray. (Smoking in this country isn’t as stigmatized as it is in the United States.) At first, I hinted politely that the smoke bothered us, and they were obliging enough, but they seemed to think moving across the room to smoke or opening a window would suffice, which doesn’t make much of a difference. I suggested spending time outside, or at our place, but they seem to take my rejections very personally. They are members of a marginalized minority, and I’m afraid they’re making assumptions about why we don’t want to spend time at their place. Which is kinder: to keep on making excuses or to be upfront about the fact that no amount of scented candles will make the air inside their house breathable to us? —Smokers Next Door The theme of this week’s column is apparently “smell-related honesty,” and in that spirit I think you should cut out the polite hints and be politely clear. Tell them you’d love to spend time together, but opening a window or smoking on the other side of the room doesn’t make a real difference, and you and your children can’t breathe comfortably in their house. Continue to invite them over to your house or catch up over the mailbox or on their front porch. If they refuse the invitation out of a misplaced sense of offense, there’s not much you can do about that, but there’s no reason to be coy about the fact that stale secondhand smoke makes you uncomfortable. * * * Dear Prudence, I started seeing someone a couple of months ago. Things moved really quickly, and within three weeks he was calling me his girlfriend and introducing me to his friends, and we had a conversation about being exclusive. Now all of a sudden he feels like we rushed into things (We did! He did!), and he wants to see other people. Although this was something I would have been open to initially, I don’t think it’s likely that I can dial back the feelings that have developed over the past few months to the point where I’d be comfortable with this arrangement. I’m in a demanding graduate school program that means I don’t have a lot of free time, so I think a likely outcome if I agree to his terms is that he would see other people while I would not. I’m pretty sure that’s not what I want. We’ve put off this conversation for a little while so I can address some school-related deadlines. What’s the best way to navigate this impending talk? —Seeing Other People Tell him what you just told me: that you did not initiate any of the earlier conversations about commitment, but now that you two have been a couple for a few months, you’re developing real feelings for him and don’t think you’d have either the free time or the inclination to go back to seeing one another nonexclusively. He’s entitled to change his mind, but if that’s the way he feels about your relationship, it’s better to part ways now, if you no longer want the same things, rather than set up an old-yet-new arrangement that benefits him but not you. * * * Dear Prudence, We live in a rural wooded area. My neighbor has a cat that lives primarily outdoors. He is often gone for days at a time, and other neighbors feed the cat and have taken her in during the winter. I feel bad for the cat for being out in the bad weather, and there are lots of animals such as raccoons, coyotes, and foxes that could harm her. We often see cats that have been killed by cars, too. She wears a collar and otherwise looks well–cared for. I’m moving into a new house and want to take the cat with me, keep her indoors, and give her a loving and safe home. The consensus among most people I have discussed this casually with say I should take her. A couple have said it would be unethical and maybe even illegal. What should I do? —Would-Be Cat Thief Top Comment Hey! LW! I think you and DJT need to learn the same lesson: DON\"T GRAB A KITTY THAT ISN'T YOURS! More... 1.8k Comments Join In You disagree with the way your neighbor approaches cat ownership; it does not follow that you therefore have the right to steal his cat. Having an outdoor cat is neither illegal nor abusive—you could not, for example, report your neighbor to animal control and have the cat removed from his home on those grounds. It’s possible for reasonable adults who genuinely care about their pets to differ on the indoor/outdoor debate. An indoor-only lifestyle reduces the risk of accident, disease, and animal attacks; it can also lead to distress and behavioral problems, as it reduces the cat’s ability to express natural predatory behavior. There are good reasons for either choice, depending on the temperament of the cat in question. You yourself acknowledge that the cat looks “well–cared for” and has a collar, so this is clearly not a neglected animal that has been abandoned to fend for itself. If you would like to own an indoor cat, go to your local shelter and get one. Discuss this column with Dear Prudence on her Facebook page!

      "text" : "Brigitte Trogneux and Emmanuel Macron. Photo: AFP/AFP/Getty Images  On Sunday, the first round of voting in the French presidential race narrowed the candidates down to infamous far-right leader Marine Le Pen, and the front-runner, centrist independent Emmanuel Macron. As Macron moves closer to the presidency, one petit fun fact about him is making the news cycle: He’s married to a woman 25 years his senior, who also happened to be his teacher back in high school. In a story that would likely sink a candidate’s chances in a more uptight country (uh, here), the 39-year-old Macron first met his 64-year-old wife, Brigitte Trogneux, when he was 15. More specifically, she was a drama teacher and he was playing the lead role in the school’s adaptation of the Milan Kundera play, Jacques and His Master. If you were wondering how this story could possibly get more French, Trogneux is reportedly from a family of “respected chocolatiers in the northern French town of Amiens.” Trogneux was married at the time, and though there are rumors that they had an affair, it’s unclear when their romance actually began. They wed in 2007 and Macron now has several step-grandchildren. In a recently published book, Macron is reportedly quoted as saying, “Nobody would call it unusual if the age difference was reversed” — and, well, he does have a point. The Independent Reuters",

Ask me your questions on the voicemail of the Dear Prudence podcast. Just leave a message at 401-371-DEAR (3327), and you may hear your question answered on a future episode of the show. Dear Prudence, Four years ago, in my early 20s, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and ended up having a double mastectomy. My boyfriend left shortly after I finished treatment. I’m ready to dip my toe into dating again. How do I discuss my surgeries, occasional low energy levels, and what I did with several years of my life? If it wasn’t obvious, I would put the conversation off until a relationship got serious. However, some of my scars are obvious in my everyday clothes, let alone when I get physical with someone. I tried dating a few years ago, but the men picked up on my weakness and used it to manipulate me. It seems harder to explain to guys my age. People say the right guy will be cool with it, but finding the right guy is hard enough! How and when do I broach this? —Dating After Mastectomy Subscribe to Prudie! With the caveat that you should broach your history with cancer and your double mastectomy only when you feel ready, I think there’s a lot to be said for saying something right away. You say that previous men have “picked up on [your] weakness,” and one way you can forestall such predatory behavior is by refusing to allow them to treat your medical history as a weakness. Don’t think of this as something that must happen within the first X minutes of the first date. But whenever the conversation naturally heads toward your respective life stories, tell your dates matter-of-factly that you had cancer in your early 20s and that you’re in remission now. You can spend a few minutes giving them the broad outline of what happened, then move on to something else you’d like to discuss. If absolutely nothing else, this will weed out the kind of guy who would consider your having had cancer four years ago as a strike against you. Frankly, it’s not just “the right guy” who would be cool with it; most reasonable people would be able to take the news in stride, without either fleeing in horror or looking to manipulate you as the result of learning you had a mastectomy—whether or not the dates lead somewhere serious. You’ve had what sounds like some pretty bad experiences with men in the past; may you meet better specimens in the future. Advertisement * * * Dear Prudence, It is a tradition in my husband’s family to name the firstborn grandchild after a grandparent. My husband is named for his grandfather. Since my husband’s mother died young, we named our daughter after both his parents (think “Josephine Marie”). My father in-law was very enthusiastic about this and adores our daughter. But since finding out our second child is going to be a boy, he expects us to name the child after him again and says it doesn’t count with a girl! I think matching boy-girl sibling names are way too cutesy, and I also want to acknowledge my side of the family, but I’m furious over my father-in-law’s dismissal of his granddaughter. I am worried this will persist as our children grow up, and I don’t want my daughter to be shoved aside for her brother’s benefit. Talking to my father-in-law has gone nowhere, and he just dismisses our concerns. My husband wants to ignore the issue, name the baby what we want, and that “Dad will come around.” I think there is a deeper issue here. This has really dampened my happiness over my pregnancy. Am I overreacting or what? Please advise. —No Second Name For what it’s worth, I don’t think your husband is “ignoring the issue,” given that together you’ve already had numerous conversations with his father and plan on naming your second child something else. No longer trying to persuade your father-in-law is, in fact, a sensible course of action. If he presses the subject, you can let him know the matter is closed, that he already has a grandchild named after him, and that you’re no longer inviting feedback on what to name your as-yet-unborn son. Give him the opportunity to gracefully get a hold of himself and realize what an honor it is to have anyone named after you. If he does, you can consider this a weird, self-absorbed blip, and move on. I don’t think it’s a sure thing he will ignore his granddaughter once your son is born. You say he adores her, so it’s likely this strange fixation on his grandson’s name has more to do with identifying with an AMAB child than it does with a desire to cast his granddaughter aside. The former still has plenty to do with sexism and outdated gender ideas, to be sure, but it’s not a guarantee that he’s going to be a lousy grandfather. Just say no, refuse to brook further discussion on the subject, and see how it goes. Advertisement * * * Dear Prudence, Recently an encounter with my partner’s father went very wrong. He started using a racial slur in my home and persisted even after my partner asked him to stop. I asked him again to stop and he started calling me names, so I told him to leave. According to my partner’s mother (who supports us), my partner’s father now thinks I am a literal witch and he has taken my partner out of his will. My partner and his father have had numerous problems in the past, and I know that he will not apologize and will likely say more hateful things to me. I also know that I will have to see him again and I want to know what is the best way to handle this. I have never, ever fought with someone like this, especially not with a partner’s family. I feel ashamed, though I know that my partner stands with me. Do I approach him as I normally would? Go “gray rock“ with him? —At Odds I’m not sure why you or your partner “have to” see his father again. Presumably if a casual acquaintance came into your home, started using racial slurs until you had to force them to leave, then later refused to apologize, you would not continue seeing them socially; I see no reason why you should behave differently just because your partner has the misfortune to be related to this guy. There are basic rules that govern civil human interactions, and refraining from (or at least apologizing for) hateful, racist behavior has got to be the most easily achievable of them all. If you had to live with your partner’s father out of financial necessity, I might advise you to keep your interactions with him limited and neutral, but you and your partner are both independent adults, and even if your partner has to visit his father, you do not. Since his father doesn’t believe he did anything wrong and is likely to behave similarly in the future, I think you (and your partner) should re-evaluate whether you want to spend any time with him at all.

Dear Prudence, My sister went through a very difficult time in her 20s that was marked by alcoholism, depression, periodic homelessness, and more than one arrest and conviction. For a couple of years, she lived with a boyfriend who had addiction issues but was otherwise a very nice guy who cared about her. He got into much more serious legal trouble than she did and is currently serving 20 years for a string of robberies. For a while my sister kept in touch with him, occasionally visited, and put money in his prison account, all while getting sober herself and putting her life back on track. His family members are all also addicts, so my sister and our parents were the only contact he had with the outside. Eventually my sister met and married a great guy, and they moved abroad. Her last communication with her imprisoned ex was about three years ago. The ex recently reached out to my parents and asked my mom to forward a letter to my sister. My sister does not want the letter, but my mom is torn about whether or not to write him back to let him know my sister has left the country and is doing well, or just let the letter go down a black hole. What is the right thing to do? Advertisement —Tell Him She’s Married? There are two interests worth balancing here. One is that your sister has the right to end her communication with her ex-boyfriend, even if she does so in a way that you find abrupt or unreasonable, even unkind. The other is that your parents (and you, although you don’t mention whether you’re in direct contact with your sister’s ex) have a right to maintain an independent relationship with this man they’ve known for years. That doesn’t mean they should offer details about your sister’s personal life to him without her permission, however. It’s also not particularly important where she lives or who she’s married to—if she doesn’t want to get any more letters from him, she can decline them just as easily from Boise as she does from Moscow. Your mother doesn’t have to let the letter disappear into the ether; she can just tell him that your sister has decided she doesn’t want to remain in contact. But if you or your parents are interested in maintaining your own friendship with him, you’re also free to make that clear, and to talk about topics that aren’t related to his former relationship with your sister. * * * Dear Prudence, I work in a small office with a limited staff, and we can hear literally everything that happens from our work spaces. A new colleague has the most unfortunate bathroom experiences every day. From our desks, we can hear every sound. It also smells, and sometimes she leaves leftovers behind. She bought air freshener, so she must be aware there’s something going on. Can I say something? Maybe post a note to flush twice? It is so uncomfortable and I am so grossed out I try to avoid that bathroom at all costs, sometimes holding my pee all day until I can run across the parking lot to the building next door and use the public restrooms in the lobby. Advertisement —Office Etiquette Right-ho. If absolutely nothing else, please stop trying to stave off bathroom visits all day as holding in your urine is bad for your kidneys. If you absolutely can’t stand to use the office bathroom, please don’t wait until the end of the day to visit the public toilets across the parking lot. There’s nothing inappropriate about posting a sign encouraging everyone to flush repeatedly if necessary and make sure they’ve left the bathroom as clean as they found it; it’s unfortunate it’s come to the point of having to leave a note at all (especially among a small staff where it may be obvious who it’s directed at), but this is the best solution to a messy problem. I’m not sure a direct conversation would be anything other than embarrassing for the both of you—I can’t think of a non-awkward way to ask someone to use the bathroom less obtrusively. Your co-worker may suffer from Crohn’s disease or a similar ailment, but even if she isn’t ill, presumably she is not doing this recreationally but out of an unfortunate necessity. The note (coupled with the new air freshener) will hopefully help, as might an office fan or white noise machine or easy-listening jazz. The human body is a necessary, horrible vessel; we all have to ride around in these failing flesh-machines, doing our absolute best with what we’ve got. * * * A Slate Plus Special Feature: Help! Why Does My Boyfriend Have So Many Wet Dreams? Dear Prudence answers more of your questions—only for Slate Plus members. Dear Prudence, My parents are moving away from the town where I live and work in a couple of months. They’re leaving me a house with three bedrooms: one upstairs, two downstairs. We have decided that I’ll stay on the top floor while we rent the bottom two bedrooms out to help with the upkeep and so I don’t have to stay in a big house by myself. I have talked about this with some of my co-workers, a few of whom have expressed interest. Apparently, my mother let it slip to my boss, whom she knew well, that we’re renting the rooms. My boss mentioned that my direct supervisor is also looking for a room (our house is close to where I work) and that it might be a “good idea” for her to live there. Prudie, I can think of so many reasons that being a landlord to my supervisor is a bad idea. My good relationship with my supervisor is based on the careful separation of my personal and professional lives; this is not going to happen if we live together. As some of my co-workers and now my boss knows about my living situation, it’s inevitable that my supervisor is going to find out, and knowing her, there’s a 90 percent chance she’ll ask to move in with me. How can I politely decline without sacrificing my career prospects or our good working relationship? —Open House ... but Not for You If your supervisor is remotely reasonable, surely you could say, “Acting as landlord to my direct supervisor would unnecessarily complicate our working relationship, which is very important to me” without sacrificing anything. If your supervisor is not remotely reasonable, you might try for a polite fiction if and when she asks for a rental application: “Thanks so much for asking, but I’ve already found tenants for the empty rooms.” (You might then try as quickly as you can to find tenants to make your polite fiction reality.) Or, if you think your community is too small for you to get away with lying about who’s moving in with you, try keeping your response impersonal. Make it clear that it’s nothing against your supervisor, but that you need to keep your work and private lives separate, and won’t be looking for housemates who work at your company. This would, unfortunately, likely mean that you would no longer be able to consider the colleagues you’d already been speaking to, but that may be for the best. It’s never a bad idea to keep a sharp division between the people you work with and the people you collect rent checks from. Whatever you decide to do, if you feel your prospects at this company depend upon your giving your supervisor a place to live, you should consider trying to find work elsewhere.

      "text" : "Like the best marketing terms, “vanlife” is both highly specific and expansive.CreditPhotograph by Jeff Minton for The New Yorker Emily King and Corey Smith had been dating for five months when they took a trip to Central America, in February, 2012. At a surf resort in Nicaragua, Smith helped a lanky American named Foster Huntington repair the dings in his board. When the waves were choppy, the three congregated in the resort’s hammock zone, where the Wi-Fi signal was strongest. One afternoon, Huntington listened to the couple have a small argument. Something about their fond irritation made him think that they’d be suited to spending long periods of time together in a confined space. “You guys would be great in a van,” he told them. The year before, Huntington had given up his apartment in New York and his job as a designer at Ralph Lauren, and moved into a 1987 Volkswagen Syncro. He spent his days surfing, exploring, and taking pictures of his van parked in picturesque locations along the California coast. It was the early days of Instagram, and, over time, Huntington accumulated more than a million followers. He represented a new kind of social-media celebrity, someone famous not for starring in movies or recording hit songs but for documenting an enviable life. “My inspiration,” went a typical comment on one of his posts. “God I wish my life was that free and easy and amazing.” Huntington tagged his posts with phrases like #homeiswhereyouparkit and #livesimply, but the tag he used most often was #vanlife. King and Smith left Nicaragua for Costa Rica, but the idea of the van stuck with them. King, a telegenic former business student, had quit her job at a Sotheby’s branch when she realized that she was unhappy. Smith, a competitive mountain biker and the manager of a kayak store, had never had a traditional office job. They figured they could live cheaply in a van while placing what they loved—travelling, surfing, mountain biking—at the center of their lives. When King found out that she’d been hired for a Web-development job that didn’t require her presence in an office, it suddenly seemed feasible. King and Smith, who are thirty-two and thirty-one, respectively, had grown up watching “Saturday Night Live” sketches in which a sweaty, frantic Chris Farley character ranted, “I am thirty-five years old, I am divorced, and I live in a van down by the river!” But, the way Huntington described it, living in a vehicle sounded not pathetic but romantic. “I remember coming home and telling my mom, ‘I have something to tell you,’ ” King said. “She thought I was going to say we were getting married or having a baby. But I said, ‘We’re going to live in a van.’ ” Huntington’s vanlife hashtag was a joking reference to Tupac’s “thug life” tattoo. “You know, it’s not thug life—it’s van life!” he told me. Six years later, more than 1.2 million Instagram posts have been tagged #vanlife. In 2013, Huntington used Kickstarter to fund “Home Is Where You Park It,” a sixty-five-dollar book of his vanlife photographs, which is now in its fourth printing. In October, Black Dog & Leventhal will publish his second book on the topic, “Van Life.” Scroll through the images tagged #vanlife on Instagram and you’ll see plenty of photos that don’t have much to do with vehicles: starry skies, campfires, women in leggings doing yoga by the ocean. Like the best marketing terms, “vanlife” is both highly specific and expansive. It’s a one-word life-style signifier that has come to evoke a number of contemporary trends: a renewed interest in the American road trip, a culture of hippie-inflected outdoorsiness, and a life free from the tyranny of a nine-to-five office job. Vanlife is an aesthetic and a mentality and, people kept telling me, a “movement.” S. Lucas Valdes, the owner of the California-based company GoWesty, a prominent seller of Volkswagen-van parts, compared vanlife today to surfing a couple of decades ago. “So many people identify with the culture, the attire, the mind-set of surfers, but probably only about ten per cent of them surf,” he said. “That’s what we’re trying to tap into.” “You could buy these vans ten years ago for pennies on the dollar,” Harley Sitner, the owner of Peace Vans, a Volkswagen-van repair and rental shop in Seattle, told me. Sitner, who is forty-nine, said that his generation’s adventurous rite of passage was more along the lines of “backpacking through Southeast Asia, eating mushrooms on a beach in Thailand.” Around five years ago, he began to notice that young people were increasingly interested in old VW vans. “It’s men in their thirties with huge beards, and they’re pretty much all stay-at-home dads,” he said. “Their wives work office jobs and they work on the vans so the family can go out and vanlife on the weekend.” Part of the fun of vanlife, Sitner theorized, is the old-fashioned, analog pleasure of tinkering. But vanlife, as a concept and as a self-defined community, is primarily a social-media phenomenon. Attaching a name (and a hashtag) to the phenomenon has also enabled people who would otherwise just be rootless wanderers to make their travels into a kind of product. “There are now professional vanlifers,” Huntington told me, sounding slightly scandalized. Vanlifers have a tendency to call their journeys “projects,” and to describe them in the elevator-pitch terms that make sense to potential sponsors. While still in Central America, King and Smith came up with a name for their project: Where’s My Office Now, a reference to their goal of fusing travel and work. “We wanted to see if it was possible to combine this nomadic hippie life with a nine-to-five job,” Smith explained. After the couple returned from Central America but before they bought a van, King registered a Web site and set up social-media accounts. “The business part of me knew there was potential,” she said. Smith, who was still using a flip phone, was suspicious of his girlfriend’s preoccupation with social media, worrying that it would detract from the experience. But there was never any doubt about what kind of vehicle they were looking for. Some vanlifers drive shiny new Mercedes Sprinter vans or practical Ford Econolines, but the quintessential van is the Volkswagen Vanagon, beloved for its bulky, unaerodynamic shape. “It’s the Swiss Army knife of the R.V. world,” Smith explained. “And the community is great. And it was going to look great in the photos.” That winter, while living in New England, he and King bought a cream-colored 1987 Vanagon Camper from a woman in upstate New York for thirty-five hundred dollars. The van was sturdy and full of personality; it had a rusty undercarriage and was wired with an external P.A. system that made animal sounds. They called it Boscha, because it sounded like the name of a German grandmother. They gave away their business-casual clothes and sold their car. In January, 2013, they left New Hampshire during a snowstorm and headed south. Their first post from the road, a picture of the van driving through snowy woods, got ninety-seven likes. On the first day, the van slid backward down an icy hill and had to be towed. They drove through winds so strong that they worried that Boscha was thrown out of alignment. Progress was slow; even in optimal conditions, the van couldn’t go faster than sixty miles per hour. King and Smith spent Valentine’s Day at a truck stop in Albuquerque, where a security guard accused them of being prostitutes. The uncertainty of life on the road was a constant low-level drain at first, particularly for King, who discovered that she was afraid of the dark. “Who’s ready for some din-din?” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon After the engine conked out in Arizona, a tow truck delivered them to an R.V. park in Sedona. They stayed there for a month while Smith replaced every ground wire in the van. One afternoon, he called GoWesty to talk through a puzzling repair situation. On a whim, he asked a GoWesty manager named Jad Josey if the company did sponsorships. By the end of the day, Josey had e-mailed Smith a one-page contract, asking for periodic social-media mentions in exchange for discounts and subsidized repairs. GoWesty’s sales have increased fifty-five per cent in the past five years, thanks in part to the vanlife trend. The company now sponsors fifteen vanlife projects, including one run by a couple selling crêpes and one by a touring folk musician. Smith, who had seen similar deals between cycling companies and mountain-bike racers, was familiar with this kind of arrangement. “I don’t think of myself as an employee of GoWesty but more like an ambassador for their vibe,” Smith told me. He began to see that the time King was spending on social media might have a point after all. Smith and King slowly grew accustomed to their itinerant life style. They hiked the Grand Canyon and visited hot springs in Oregon. King’s stress abated. With every mechanical breakdown, Smith became more confident handling repairs. He also developed a repertoire of meals suited to the van’s two-burner kitchen. His specialty was a dish he called huevos vancheros: eggs fried in coconut oil, seasoned with turmeric, served over buckwheat with salsa and sauerkraut. The couple bought things to make the van homier and more comfortable: a fruit basket, a travel bidet. Working on the road proved harder than expected. Smith took occasional part-time jobs—as a mountain-bike guide; as a P.A. for a television show about aliens—but King was the primary breadwinner. “I was working anywhere from fifteen to forty hours a week, which doesn’t seem like a lot, but when you’re driving around and having all that motion, and what I guess you could call the stress of vanlife—not knowing where you’re going to sleep that night—the anxiety was still there,” she said. “We could never really go deep into national parks or national forests, because I had to always be on call.” A year into their journey, Smith and King met Zach Driftwood and Andrew Knapp, photographers who were touring in a van to promote a book featuring images of Knapp’s dog. Driftwood and Knapp made money from their popular social-media feeds, through product placement and partnerships with brands. In the course of Smith and King’s travels, their following on Instagram had climbed into the tens of thousands, but they had never been paid for a post. Driftwood encouraged the couple to focus on Instagram if they wanted that to change. “He made it clear it was very viable,” King said. In August, 2015, King quit her Web-development job. The following spring, Where’s My Office Now posted its first paid, sponsored image to Instagram, on behalf of the water-bottle company Hydro Flask. It showed King heating water in a teakettle, a light-blue thermos conspicuous in the background. “Our bodies, the most precious vehicle for our journey here, run on water,” she wrote in the caption. “A big thank you to @hydroflask for creating durable water bottles that help shift the bottled/privatization of water paradigm.” King and Smith were now professional vanlifers. They began working more product placement into their Instagram posts. Since then, their sponsorships—which King prefers to call “alliances”—have included Kettle Brand potato chips, Clif Bars, and Synergy Organic Clothing. Last summer, the tourism board of Saskatchewan paid the couple seven thousand dollars to drive around the grasslands of central Canada with other popular vanlifers, documenting their (subsidized) kayaking trips and horseback rides. On a drizzly Tuesday in February, I met Smith and King in front of GoWesty’s offices, in the chilled-out oceanside town of Los Osos, California. The parking lot was full of snub-nosed Vanagons in various states of disrepair. So many road-trippers make pit stops at GoWesty that the company has installed a public shower and bathroom. Smith is short and broad-shouldered, with a mechanic’s scraped-up knuckles. He wanted me to see Boscha, which was up on a lift in the back of the shop, its undercarriage exposed, suffering from as yet undiagnosed engine trouble. Because Where’s My Office Now is one of GoWesty’s most high-profile sponsored projects, the company does some upgrades and any necessary repairs—which would likely amount to thousands of dollars of work—for free. This was GoWesty’s second major overhaul of the van; in 2015, it did a thorough upgrade, replacing the engine, the cooling system, the bumpers, and the wheels, and adding a bike rack. GoWesty had loaned the couple a van so that they could get back on the road while Boscha was being fixed. They had spent the previous four months holed up at their parents’ homes in New England, as King recovered from an intestinal parasite she’d picked up on a backpacking trip in Montana. It was the longest the couple had stayed in one place—and not slept in a van—in four years, and the time off the road presented a problem. Where’s My Office Now has nearly a hundred and forty thousand Instagram followers and a dozen corporate sponsors; maintaining that kind of audience requires constant tending. King, who is largely responsible for the project’s social-media presence, had done her best to post images from older travels, but the archive was getting thin. As the afternoon got progressively gloomier, Smith and King transferred their belongings from Boscha to the loaner van: two surfboards (bought at a discount from a sponsor), wetsuits, tins of red lentils and buckwheat, stacks of T-shirts and leggings (mostly from sponsors), a woven blanket (a gift from a sponsor), a hand broom, two yoga mats, three hula hoops in different sizes, a tool kit, a digital S.L.R. camera, and a bag of wheat-free kibble for their soulful, brindled dog, Penny. A sticker on their portable fridge read “It’s not a slow car, it’s a fast house.” The couple travel lighter than they used to—when they first set out, they lashed five bikes to the back of the van. We didn’t pull out of the GoWesty parking lot until almost two the following afternoon, three hours behind schedule. A surfing app on Smith’s phone indicated that a promising swell was approaching Southern California, so he headed south on the 101. The borrowed van, a 1990 four-wheel-drive Syncro, made disconcerting noises. “You’re wrestling with the van, wrestling with the wind, every truck that goes by you vibrates you,” Smith said. King sat cross-legged in the back seat, replying to e-mails. At a rest stop, a man in his fifties stepped out of a white S.U.V. and eyed the van hungrily. “I bet that can go anywhere,” he said. Smith, who seemed to have an infinite capacity for small talk, stood in the rain and chatted with him. King was fretful about the delay; sponsors were clamoring for posts. “We really need to create content,” she said. “And that’s hard to do in this concrete jungle.” It had been an extremely wet winter in California, and more rain was expected. At sunset, we were stuck in rush-hour traffic near Santa Barbara, windshield wipers ticking, as a chain of red brake lights snaked up the freeway in front of us. It was after dark when we pulled into a campground by the ocean, outside Ventura. Smith found a parking spot between two hulking R.V.s, their generators thrumming. On sunny days, with the doors wide open, the van seemed spacious enough that the R.V.s baffled me; what on earth did they need all that room for? But on a chilly night, with the doors shut against the rain, three adults and a dog made the van feel cramped. Smith and King seemed to have developed an unspoken system for sharing space, but everywhere I stationed myself I was in the way. Scrolling through King and Smith’s Instagram feed in chronological order, you can see the couple become better at tailoring the images to what their followers want. “They want to see Emily in a bikini, they want to see a sunflare, they want to see the van,” Smith said.Photography by Jeff Minton for The New Yorker Smith made vegetarian chili that night. After dinner, King lit a stick of incense to cover up the mingled smells of cumin, damp dog, and unwashed human. Smith set up the Syncro’s pop-top and strapped on a rainfly. I clambered up to the loft and lay awake in the small wedge of space under the ceiling, listening to the rain pelt the van. Ken Ilgunas spent most of two years living in a van when he was a graduate student at Duke University in order to avoid racking up debt, an experience he chronicled in a book called “Walden on Wheels,” published in 2013. Living in a van makes you thriftier and more self-reliant, Ilgunas told me. You learn to live with discomfort, a quality that he doesn’t see in the Instagram version of vanlife. “My van never looked like anything out of a Wes Anderson film,” he said. “It was difficult for me to wash my cooking pots. For a couple of weeks, I had mice living in my ceiling upholstery. There were times the van got so hot I thought I would die if I took a nap. And it was lonely. Just knowing that I would have to tell women where I lived deterred even the thought of dating.” In contrast, the vans on Instagram look like “aesthetically pleasing jewelry boxes,” Ilgunas said. “Usually with one or two good-looking people sprawled out in bed in front of a California beach.” It’s true that the same vanlife pictures get taken over and over: the van’s back doors opening onto an ocean vista; a long-exposure nighttime shot of the van, cozy and lit from within, against a backdrop of stars; a woman on the van’s roof, in the middle of a sun salutation. (There are so many images of vans parked in improbably beautiful places—the middle of a lake, the edge of a cliff—that there’s an Instagram account called You Did Not Sleep There, devoted to collecting the least believable ones.) One vanlife trope, a middle-distance shot of a van on an empty, winding road, seems more self-consciously artificial than most: someone clearly had to hop out and run back to get the shot. The ideal vanlife image has something of the hazy impersonality of a photograph in an upscale catalogue, depicting a scene that’s both attractive and unspecific enough that viewers can imagine themselves into it. There is an undeniable aesthetic and demographic conformity in the vanlife world. Nearly all of the most popular accounts belong to young, attractive, white, heterosexual couples. “There’s the pretty van girl and the woodsy van guy,” Smith said. “That’s what people want to see.” At times, the vanlife community seems full of millennials living out a leftover baby-boomer fantasy: the Volkswagens, the neo-hippie fashions, the retro gender dynamics. But, for all its twee escapism, vanlife is a trend born out of the recent recession. “We heard all these promises about what will happen after you go to college and get a degree,” Smith said. “We graduated at a time when all that turned out to be a bunch of bullshit.” The generation that’s fuelling the trend has significantly more student debt and lower rates of homeownership than previous cohorts. The rise of contract and temporary labor has further eroded young people’s financial stability. “I think there’s a sense of hopelessness in my generation, in terms of jobs,” Foster Huntington said. “And it’s cheap to live in a van.” And so, like staycations and minimalism, vanlife is an attempt to aestheticize and romanticize the precariousness of contemporary life. “It looks like they’re having fun,” Huntington said, of King and Smith. “But they’re working a lot.” During the couple’s four years on the road, hundreds of people have contacted Smith for advice. Last year, he began providing donation-based vanlife consulting, offering to help people “live [their] vanlife vision.” So far, he has had meetings on the phone with around a dozen people. “They never want to know what the most beautiful place is,” he told me. “They want to know: Where do you pee? How do you and Emily not kill each other?” The answer to the first question is relatively simple: outside, or in campground bathrooms, or—on particularly cold nights or stretches of road with little privacy—in a plastic yogurt container. The second is more complicated. “Everything is magnified, because it’s such a small space,” King told me. “The trash is in our face, the dishes are in our face, Corey is in my face, I’m in his face. Any personality conflicts, ego conflicts, it’s all right there.” Most of the couple’s fights revolve around organization: when and how often to sweep out the van; whether they can wait until the morning to do the dishes; if they’re posting frequently enough. Smith is neat, and a self-described “planner”; when stressed, he can edge toward control-freak territory. (One afternoon, he watched me tear into a bag of corn chips and shook his head in disappointment. “You open bags wrong, too,” he said.) This regularly brings him into conflict with King, who is more flexible and fanciful, and occasionally prone to sloppiness. In Smith’s consulting sessions, he encourages couples to develop separate habits and to find small ways to spend time apart. While Smith cooks breakfast, King walks the dog; in the afternoons, he’ll go for a long bike ride while she practices yoga and writes in her journal. “Having good weather helps a lot,” King told me. On another rainy morning in Ventura, the air smelled like salt and R.V. exhaust. King checked Instagram on her phone; her most recent post, a shot of a storm building over the Pacific, had been something of an aesthetic departure—most Where’s My Office Now images include King, the van, or Penny; the most popular tend to include all three—and it was underperforming. “I don’t think people are even reading this post, because it’s a picture of the ocean and apparently people don’t want to look at that,” she said testily. King and Smith have posted more than thirteen hundred photographs to their account. Scrolling through the feed in chronological order, you can see King, who shoots most of the photos, become better at composing and editing images, and at tailoring them to what the audience wants to see. In the early days, she took pictures of flowers and sunsets. “I’d never post something like that now,” she said, looking at a closeup of ripening blackberries, from four years ago. As I thumbed toward the top of the screen, I had the disconcerting sense of watching a life become a life-style brand. King clicked on the account’s most successful post, which has more than eight thousand likes. In the image, the back seat of the van is folded down into a bed; King faces away from the camera, holding a sheet to her chest, her hair cascading down her naked back. The second most popular post was of King wearing a bikini, standing on the van’s front bumper. In the next most popular, King is in a bikini, slicing lemons. “People really want to see beautiful locations,” King said. “They want to see Emily in a bikini, they want to see a sun flare, they want to see the van,” Smith said. “Ones of Emily in the van waking up with Penny, they crush it.” “It’s real and it’s kind of moody—” “It’s a naked female,” Smith said. “If I’m in that picture, it gets three thousand likes.” “Sorry. I have no interest in being your gay best friend. Try human resources.” Share Tweet Buy a cartoon Later that afternoon, a rust-brown 1984 Vanagon Westfalia with a vanlife decal on its rear window pulled in to the parking lot. The driver introduced himself as Mike Hagy, a forty-two-year-old ad-agency art director from Santa Monica, and a fan of Where’s My Office Now. He had seen on Instagram that Smith and King were in Ventura and decided to come say hello. “In a vanlife-geek kind of way, they are kind of celebrities,” he said. “I live in L.A., so seeing celebrities is no big thing—I almost hit Leonardo DiCaprio surfing once. But I was all excited to come down here. My friend was, like, ‘You’re such a dork.’ ” The collapsing distance between brand and life has led to social-media influencing, in which advertisers pay for endorsements from people with strong online followings. Celebrity endorsements aren’t new, of course, but influencer marketing expands the category of “celebrity” to include teen-age fashionistas, drone racers, and particularly photogenic dogs. Advertisers work with people like Smith and King precisely because they’re not famous in the traditional sense. They’re appealing to brands because they have such a strong emotional connection with their followers. Krishna Subramanian, the co-founder of captiv8, a company that has helped Where’s My Office Now connect with advertisers, said, “Their followers know what they’re doing day in and day out.” Accounts with between fifty thousand and two hundred thousand followers are considered “microinfluencers,” and tend to have higher engagement rates—that is, a larger share of their followers like, favorite, or comment on their posts—than those with millions of followers. “It’s very niche-focussed,” Subramanian said. “That’s really interesting to an advertiser who wants to promote something very specific to that audience.” One study estimated that the social-media-influencer market was worth five hundred million dollars in 2015; the market is expected to increase to at least five billion dollars by 2020. Though King and Smith have worked out some of their branding partnerships directly, a growing number of companies serve as intermediaries between influencers and brands. Talent agencies develop entire social-media campaigns; tech startups, including captiv8, have built businesses around analytics platforms that identify potential influencers and evaluate the reach of digital campaigns. Top social-media influencers receive tens of thousands of dollars for endorsing a product, but King and Smith aren’t there yet; they make between five hundred and fifteen hundred dollars for each sponsored post. Last year, their first year attempting to earn a living primarily through social media, they made eighteen thousand dollars. In the first two months of 2017, they had already lined up ten thousand dollars’ worth of endorsements. Smith and King told me that they work only with brands they feel connected to. “We try to leverage the power we have as influencers in the social-media world to bring light to companies that are doing good in the world, that are creating products we believe in,” King explained. “We see every dollar as a vote.” They are sponsored by several companies whose products they use every day, including TruthPaste, which makes clay-based toothpaste, and Four Sigmatic, a “superfood company” that sells instant coffee enhanced with mushroom elixirs. We had been in Ventura for two soggy days. Smith described the waves as “garbage,” and, because he chooses where and when the couple travels, he decided that it was time to move on. He had heard about a hot spring in Los Padres National Forest that he was eager to check out, and King wanted to get back to the woods, where the opportunities for content creation were better. But, in the hour it took to pack up the van, the sun began to peek through the clouds and the wind shifted direction. Smith started casting longing glances at the improving surf. “We’re kinda breaking one of our rules,” he said, as we prepared to drive out of the parking lot. “Never walk away from good waves.” He reversed back into the parking spot. As Smith pulled on his wetsuit, King unfurled her yoga mat and stretched herself into a long, luxurious forward bend. “This is what vanlife is about,” Smith said. They decided to use their extra day in Ventura to take a photograph for one of their newest sponsors, “Outsiders,” a WGN show about an Appalachian family living off the grid and battling a greedy coal company. The screener that the network provided had put King and Smith off at first. “It’s got quite a bit of violence in it,” King said. “We want to stand for peace.” But, the more they talked it over, the more they were able to rationalize the partnership. “We aren’t promoting violence, but we can’t ignore violence,” King said. It didn’t hurt that the company was offering triple their usual rate. But the collaboration had not been an easy one; King had exchanged more than seventy e-mails with the “Outsiders” reps, who asked to approve the photographs and the captions in advance, and wanted to dictate what time they were posted. (Engagement rates are the highest at 11 a.m.) Smith had a particular image in mind: King sprawled in the back of the van, reading a book about Ayurveda with Penny nestled next to her, and an “Outsiders” decal featured prominently on her laptop. As Smith shot from the front seat, King tried a few different positions—knees bent; legs propped up against the window—and pretended to read the book. “Sometimes it’s more spontaneous,” she said apologetically. “It’s about storytelling, and when you’re telling a story it’s not always spontaneous,” Smith said. “Lift your head up a little bit more, look like you’re reading.” King positioned Penny at her feet, but the dog kept moving, distracted by grebes bobbing on the waves. Smith grew frustrated by the strong contrast between the dim van interior and the bright ocean beyond. King attempted to placate him. “Corey, this is O.K., this is O.K., this is fun,” she said. After more than half an hour, Smith got a shot he was satisfied with. The next day, as he drove in the rain to Los Padres National Forest, King sat in the back and fixed the overexposed ocean in Photoshop. The post, when it went up, looked cozy and relaxed. King added a long caption, about how living in the van had made her reconsider what “work” actually means. “I no longer define work by money, instead seeing it as our focused action collectively creating our world,” she wrote. “Currently my work is storytelling and aligning with companies supporting our lifestyle and Earth.” “Such a beautiful lifestyle,” one commenter wrote. “This looks like heaven,” another said. Before we reached the forest, we stopped at another surf break, north of Ventura. A middle-aged man in a shiny Volvo station wagon pulled into the parking lot behind us. He’d seen us on the freeway and followed us, he said. He wanted to talk about vans, and self-sufficiency, and freedom. Just a few days into vanlife, I had become accustomed to this kind of encounter: the hunger in the eyes of middle-aged men at the sight of old Volkswagens, and how not entirely bad it felt to be a symbol that other people projected their fantasies onto. Smith smiled politely as the man kept talking. “You’re survivors,” the man said emphatically, thumping his steering wheel. “You’re living in reality.” ♦",

Too close for comfort: I have always been a little claustrophobic, but it has never been a big problem until recently. My boyfriend and I were making out when he suddenly let his full body weight drop on top of me. He’s a good 100 pounds heavier so I could hardly move. I started to panic, which was made worse when I started being unable to breath, which led to a massive, hyperventilating freakout. At first my boyfriend was really worried, but when I finally calmed down enough to explain, he thought that it was hilarious and that he could cure me of my phobia. He’ll randomly sneak up behind me, wrap his arms and legs around mine, essentially making his body a cage for mine, and refuse to let go. The more I struggle the tighter he holds on. He thinks if I just get used to it I’ll relax and be OK, except I can’t relax and these sessions usually end with me sobbing/hysterical/hyperventilating. I’ve even passed out. I’ve tried telling him to stop, that it’s not his job to “cure” me, but he just becomes more determined. I’ve become completely paranoid and can’t relax, just waiting for him to grab me. I’ve stopped initiating any intimate contact and feel horribly anxious whenever he does. How can I make him understand that, far from helping me, he’s actually making me worse? A: Please leave him. Please, please, please leave him. Your boyfriend understands perfectly well that he is not helping you. He is acutely, terrifyingly aware that what he is doing reduces you to the point of hysterical tears and hyperventilation, and he doesn’t care. He enjoys making you feel on edge, paranoid, panicked, and unsafe. He likes making it worse, and the more you beg him to stop or try to help him understand, the more powerful and in control he feels. Subscribe to Prudie! You say the very first time this happened your boyfriend was worried until he realized you were terrified and claustrophobic, at which point he found it “hilarious” and announced his determination to “cure” you. What he means by “cure” is “torment.” He delights in tormenting you, and I’m so, so sorry this is happening. Please know that he is absolutely aware of what he is doing, that there is no way you could communicate your distress and frustration to him that would make him stop, and that you do not deserve this treatment. This is not an accident or a miscommunication. You’ve already stopped initiating intimacy, which tells me the extent to which you feel afraid, paralyzed, and unsafe around your partner. No one should ever have to feel that way in a relationship. Break up with him immediately. Don’t worry if he claims not to understand, or tries to make you feel like you’re being dramatic, that he was “just kidding around.” He’s not kidding around. He isn’t safe, and he isn’t trustworthy, and he isn’t going to stop. Q. Bloody scrooge: The annual blood drive is here. Everyone is talking about how wonderful and inclusive it is, a good cause, etc., and this year my co-worker has taken initiative on advertising for the blood drive. My problem is, as a man married to another man, even though we are monogamous and I am at no more risk for STDs than any other married person, I cannot donate blood and feel incredibly excluded and marginalized every year at this time. With my co-worker talking about it all the time, it is coming up even more. I know donating blood is an important cause. How do I reconcile this with my personal feelings of discrimination? Advertisement A: Your personal feelings of discrimination are merited and appropriate! The ban on gay and bisexual men donating blood is an outdated and unnecessarily restrictive one; the American Medical Association issued a formal statement in 2013 calling on the FDA to lift the ban, calling it “discriminatory and not based on sound science.” (Italy, for example, does not restrict blood donation on the basis of sexual orientation but whether the potential donor has recently had high-risk sexual encounters.) Currently the FDA does not allow men who have had sex with men in the past year, nor any of their female partners, to donate blood, even though all donated blood is screened for disease and lifting the ban could add more than 360,000 new donors each year. You can volunteer your time to help facilitate the blood drive, or donate money to the organization hosting it, if you want to help patients in need of blood transfusions in another way. If you’re looking for something to do with these feelings of frustration and injustice at the same time, consider contacting your legislators and urging them to encourage the FDA to revise its guidelines. Q. Charitable inheritance: I’ve just received a rather large inheritance from my grandfather. It would pay off my loans and other debts, which aren’t substantial compared with others, but are of course a reasonably large part of my monthly bills. I’m extremely fortunate—I grew up middle class and privileged, which is why I’d like to give all of it away. I want to pay off my financial debts with work wherever possible, and I want others who need money much more than I do to be able to get a leg up. I have a good job now that pays a large salary. My debts are small in comparison with other people my age, and I have company-provided health insurance. I hold no illusion that any of this is guaranteed to last, but I want to help people who could never even dream of being where I am at all. Mine is a situation many people will never find themselves lucky enough to be in. I know that it’s by sheer dumb luck that I was born into a family that could help me through life to get me to where I am now. If I donate the inheritance, I’d still like to honor my grandfather in some way, but I don’t know if the charities I’d donate to would be to his taste. Is it wrong to donate, and should I keep his preferences in mind when I do, even if they might not align with my own? A: You’re honoring your grandfather by putting your inheritance to good use. You’re not obligated to re-create his tastes and values exactly. You’re honoring your grandfather’s memory by donating the money to organizations you believe to be doing valuable and necessary work. Presumably his intention in leaving this money to you was to ensure that you were financially stable and able to contribute meaningfully to society. Luckily for you, you are already financially stable and well on your way to living debt free; give the money to wherever you think it’s likely to do the most good with a clear conscience. Q. Mid-20s crisis: My partner and I married fairly young, in our early 20s. I had never lived on my own and I lived with my parents during university. We are now in our late 20s, and I find myself angry and resentful that I never gave myself the chance to experience life with no strings attached. We are nearing 30, and I don’t feel like there’s enough time to save up and travel abroad if we want to have kids before we’re 40. At this point, it is more important to me to travel than to have kids. I constantly daydream about traveling on my own and having one-night stands without telling my partner so I can experience what I want to and still keep my marriage. I know I would be miserable alone, but I don’t know how to maintain a happy marriage and get this out of my system. Advertisement A: If nothing else, make it very clear to your partner that you don’t want to have children anytime soon, and make sure you two are very careful about birth control. If you’re angry and resentful now, imagine how much worse off you’ll be if your partner convinces you that having a child together will slake your thirst for change. As for the rest of it, I’m afraid I don’t have a more interesting solution to your problem than good old-fashioned painful honesty. Your partner cannot possibly grant you greater freedom and independence if they don’t know that’s what you want. You seem pretty clear on the fact that you love your partner and don’t want to leave them, but that you’re increasingly frustrated when it comes to monogamy and the idea that, since you’re in a committed relationship, you’re not “allowed” to travel by yourself. It may be that your partner shares some of your frustrations! Even if they don’t, it’s perfectly fine for a married person to want to travel solo, and if that’s what you want, you should tell your partner and then make it happen. The monogamy conversation will likely be trickier (and ongoing), but it’s better to have an honest argument, or an honest series of arguments, then start up a series of secret one-night stands. It may be that once you open up about your reluctance to have children right now (do you want to have them at all? Because you don’t have to! Children are optional!), your desire to travel and spend more time alone, to develop more of a sense of independence, your longing for one-night stands will fade. It may be that this longing does not fade, and then you will have to give your partner the opportunity to decide whether or not they are interested in navigating an open relationship with you. But don’t make that decision for them just because you’re afraid they won’t want the same things. Q. Awkward comments: My wife has an unusual sense of humor. I normally don’t mind, but sometimes her jokes take a turn for the awkward. For example, we were recently at a BBQ with a few friends. One friend had mentioned that they had recently done a big favor for another friend. My wife made several jokes about how we’ve never received such a favor from them. Her barbs weren’t particularly sharp, but it was still very awkward and likely made others cringe. On the drive home, I wanted to say something about how pointing out life’s minor inequalities isn’t necessarily prime joke material ... but I don’t even know where to begin. Or to begin at all? How do you even start a conversation about “don’t make cringe-y jokes, please?” A: It may be more helpful to your wife to provide specific examples of this behavior, and I think you should start with the most recent incident. This is likely not something she’s noticed in herself before, and you’ll have to be both tactful and honest with her if you want to encourage her to adjust. You’re not telling her she’s a socially incompetent jerk, just pointing out that every once in a while she takes a joke too far. Advertisement “I don’t know if you noticed this, but the other night you made several jokes about how Karen’s never done a big favor for us, and it made me uncomfortable. I think it made Karen uncomfortable too. I know you didn’t intend to make her feel singled out, but it came across as more than just a joke—like you thought she owed us something. I’m bringing it up not because I think you made a huge, horrible faux pas, but because I’d want you to tell me if I had inadvertently made someone else uncomfortable when I was trying to tell a joke.” Q. Re: Bloody scrooge: I didn’t know same-sex-partnered people could not donate blood, and I guess I’m not the only one. If your colleagues know your marital situation, tell them you can’t donate blood (and offer to volunteer at the sign-in table or distribute cookies, if you want). If they don’t know and you feel you must excuse yourself, fib and say for medical reasons you can’t donate (and volunteer if you want). Q. Re: Bloody scrooge: Don’t take it personally. I haven’t been able to donate blood in over a decade because I regularly travel to places that disqualify me from doing so. I understand where you’re coming from, since the restriction on gay men donating blood is definitely an antiquated holdover from a less enlightened time, but it doesn’t sound like this drive is being organized with malicious intent (and it’s very likely you’re not the only person in your office that can’t donate, for whatever reason). A: These both offer helpful distinctions! I think the letter writer’s resentment of the ban itself is legitimate, but it’s important to bear in mind that his co-workers are in no way responsible for it, and to channel his energies appropriately. Advertisement Q. Phone volume etiquette: I work in the reception area of an office with bad, echo-y acoustics; my boss works in the adjacent office. My job requires lots of phone time and often we have bad connections in which the caller asks me to speak up. This drives my boss crazy, and he says that I need to keep my voice down. But when I do, the callers can’t hear me. We live in an area with notoriously bad cell reception, so it’s common to have rough connections. Also, some callers are elderly or hard of hearing. Who should get precedence, the caller or the other people in the office? I feel like it should be the caller, but I’ve been told otherwise. In fact, for a year in college (before cells or cordless phones) my roommates refused to let me talk on the phone to my elderly father because I had to speak loudly. I recognize that high volume bothers people, but what about the person on the other line? A: This seems like a problem your boss should be helping you solve! Presumably he does not want your clients to be unable to hear you when they call. Present the situation to him and ask for help finding a solution that works for both of you: “I know you’ve asked me to keep my voice down during calls in the past, and I don’t want to disturb anyone else in the office while I’m speaking to clients. Since our connections are usually bad, most clients ask me to speak up, and can’t hear me if I speak at a normal volume. How would you like me to address this?” It may be that there’s another part of the office not quite so close to the center of things where you can take calls in relative privacy, it may be that your boss wants you to encourage clients to email you if their connection is bad, or it may be that he’ll have to walk back his initial request. Either way, he should be offering something more constructive than “keep it down” if that means your clients can’t hear what you’re saying. Q. Fiancée wants to invite ex to our wedding: My fiancée “Amy” and I will be getting married toward the end of this year. She has a child with another man, and they have a fairly cordial, if occasionally awkward, co-parenting relationship. I have met him before, and he is a good father to my soon-to-be stepdaughter. Since he is her child’s biological father, Amy would like to invite him to our wedding. In theory, I shouldn’t have a problem with this. I understand and accept that he will be in our lives for a long time. At the same time, there is a large part of me that just does not want to spend my wedding day looking at a man who has had sex with Amy. We’ve discussed it, and she says she’ll leave the final decision up to me. I’m inclined to say no. Are my feelings reasonable, or am I just being a jerk? Top Comment Whoa. Pay off your debts and save the rest of the inheritance. You have no idea what might happen to you in your life. More... 1.7k Comments Join In A: Presumably every time you look at Amy’s child you do not find yourself thinking about the fact that, in order to produce said child, she had sex with another man. You are joining Amy’s family, and her co-parent will always be a part of that family, so it’s better to get comfortable with that now. He’s not just “a man who has had sex with Amy,” he’s the father of her child and your soon-to-be-stepdaughter. You’re not a jerk for feeling insecure or jealous, but you shouldn’t let those feelings dictate your actions. You don’t have to repress or bottle up these feelings, however. Tell your soon-to-be-wife that there is a part of you that, perhaps selfishly, wishes that you could pretend neither of you existed before you met one another. Then let it go, and invite him to the wedding. He may feel similarly awkward and may not even attend—but if he does, you don’t have to do anything but be briefly polite to him, then focus on your own happiness. Mallory Ortberg: Thanks, everyone!

      "text" : "Michael Flynn arrives to deliver a statement during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington on Feb. 1. © Carlos Barria / Reuters requirejs([\"jquery\"], function($) ); News leaked on Thursday evening that retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was shopping his testimony regarding the Trump administration’s Russia ties to anyone who might listen. Specifically, the former national security adviser is saying he’s willing to talk to the FBI and both the House and Senate intelligence committees. The price? In his lawyer’s words, “assurances against unfair prosecution.” Whether Flynn deserves the requested immunity or not, or whether he will get it, and from whom, all remain unanswered questions. At this point, the Justice Department and Congress—which has its own narrow immunity authority—should probably decline Flynn’s bid because they know too little about the matter to judge whether Flynn’s price is right. (The reporting thus far is that he’s found no takers.) Advertisement Based on what’s been publicly reported, Flynn faces a long list of potential federal charges. Flynn’s conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak arguably violate the Logan Act, an arcane federal law prohibiting diplomacy by private citizens. These conversations happened during the transition and Logan Act violations are almost never prosecuted, so Flynn probably has a good defense. But various media reports suggest Flynn was evasive in interviews with federal law enforcement officials; any false statements could also be a crime. Last month, Flynn’s lawyers also filed retroactive registrations regarding Flynn’s foreign consulting work with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act—the failure to file these documents in a timely fashion could also be prosecuted. This same foreign consulting work also creates risk under the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which applies to retired military officers and requires a congressional waiver for certain foreign work. What does Flynn have to offer? Finally, Flynn may face legal risk if he failed to disclose these foreign contacts as part of his top-level security clearance applications. Not to mention potential legal risk relating to Flynn’s reported conversations with Turkish officials regarding whether a Turkish cleric could somehow be spirited out of the U.S.—conversations that could, in theory, be construed as conspiracy to commit federal crimes. An obvious but important starting point: The Justice Department probably doesn’t need Flynn’s testimony if it wants to potentially charge him with any of these offenses. It already has the transcripts of intercepted conversations with the Russians, interview notes with Flynn, legal filings by Flynn, and security clearance applications from Flynn. (Also, you normally don’t offer to testify in exchange for immunity if you think that investigators don’t independently have the goods on you.) Advertisement The most important thing to think about is this: Prosecutors don’t give immunity to get confessions; they give immunity to help build bigger cases against bigger potential defendants. For the Justice Department or Congress to take Flynn’s offer, he must offer something—or someone—they don’t already have. And it should either be someone higher up or someone who may have committed a more serious crime. Another very key point is that most immunity offers are made less publicly, following a “proffer session” in which the potential defendant unveils the goods and gives investigators a chance to decide whether the testimony is worth the price of immunity. In the Justice Department, normal immunity transactions get decided by the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division. Because of this matter’s sensitivity, and the attorney general’s recusal, the Flynn case will likely hit the desk of Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente—or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, once he’s confirmed. On the congressional side, committees conducting investigations can vote to grant immunity to witnesses. However, such decisions must be somewhat bipartisan in that they require a two-thirds vote. Get the best of Slate in your inbox. Since the government probably doesn’t need Flynn’s testimony to charge him, that means he would have to have valuable information relating to something or someone else. And since Flynn is already a pretty big catch for prosecutors in his own right, he would have to offer someone or something even bigger for an immunity deal to make sense. So what does Flynn have to offer? In Just Security, Harvard law professor and former prosecutor Alex Whiting speculates that the very public manner of Flynn’s offer suggests he has little of value to give, certainly nothing that would attract federal prosecutors. Rather, Whiting writes, Flynn maybe hoping to entice or pressure Congress into granting immunity under its authority, and do so in such a way that complicates any future federal prosecution. (Maybe he’ll get some help on the pressure front, given that his former patron in the White House—President Trump—is publicly backing an immunity deal.) Given the significant legal risk Flynn faces, this may be a rational move by his lawyers. However, it all depends on how central congressional investigators think Flynn is to their Russia inquiry—or if Congress even moves to conduct a meaningful and far-reaching inquiry, something in doubt after the House Intelligence Committee’s implosion earlier this week. Advertisement Could Flynn offer something else? To date, news reports have implicated former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former Trump policy adviser Carter Page, and outside adviser Roger Stone for their varying levels of Russia-related activity. (Each has denied any wrongdoing.) Manafort, Page, and Stone matter because of their roles on the campaign and ties to the president—but Flynn arguably outranked them, both in terms of his administration role, and his value to prosecutors. Unless Flynn has information that relates to other principals, including President Trump’s inner circle or the president himself, his testimonial offer will likely fall flat (unless of course some of these other actors did way worse things than Flynn might have done). Flynn and his lawyers may be gambling on the timing of their offer here. Congressional inquiries into the Trump administration’s Russia ties have broken down, thanks largely to a blizzard of strange behavior by House Intelligence Committee Chair Rep. Devin Nunes. The Senate Intelligence Committee appears to be moving forward with its own bipartisan inquiry, and Flynn’s testimony might be attractive to Senate investigators. Indeed, the less the White House cooperates, or the more it acts to block witnesses from testifying, the more valuable Flynn’s testimony may be to congressional investigators. However, Justice gets a vote in these immunity grants, and can delay—if not altogether block—Congress from granting immunity while its law enforcement investigations are underway. That would almost surely happen here even if Congress were interested in this offer. Top Comment I picked the wrong administration to quit sniffing glue. More... 184 Comments Join In This thin reed of hope that Flynn’s testimony may be attractive to congressional investigators was probably enough to motivate his lawyers to offer testimony in exchange for some grant of immunity. It may be the only hope Flynn has left after being publicly defenestrated 24 days into the Trump administration, although this reed is rapidly thinning as House and Senate intelligence committee members express skepticism about any grants of immunity. (Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Friday that he would need to see a proffer from Flynn, plus additional background documents, before considering any granting of immunity.) The saddest part of the statement from Flynn’s lawyer comes in the third paragraph, which describes Flynn’s long (and largely successful) career as an Army officer, culminating in his retirement as a three-star general. The contrast between that brilliant career of public service, and Flynn’s current predicament, could hardly be more stark. Even if Flynn’s immunity gambit succeeds and he avoids criminal prosecution, his actions after retirement will still have done grave harm to himself, his reputation, and the American profession of arms.",

      "text" : "Jared Kushner, senior adviser to President Trump, listens during a meeting with small-business leaders Jan. 30. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Time magazine has named top White House adviser Jared Kushner as one of its 100 most influential people. Usually, when you're given that distinction, a magazine like Time will reach out to someone who knows you and can vouch for your superior influential-ness and prowess. Instead, Kushner got Henry Kissinger. Others on the list got the at-times-hyperbolic, praise-ridden write-ups you'd expect. The prime minister of New Zealand wrote that British Prime Minister Theresa May “is the right person to guide the democratic will of Britain through the complexity of separating the U.K. from the European Union.” Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) wrote that Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) is defined by his “truly death-defying sacrifices and an almost irrational, love-fueled persistence in the cause of our country.” Former Senate Democratic leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) wrote that he has “enormous faith” in his successor, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), and “I am confident that he is the right man for this moment.” By contrast, here is Kissinger's write-up for Kushner, with whom he has apparently spoken a few times: Transitioning the presidency between parties is one of the most complex undertakings in American politics. The change triggers an upheaval in the intangible mechanisms by which Washington runs: an incoming President is likely to be less familiar with formal structures, and the greater that gap, the heavier the responsibility of those advisers who are asked to fill it. This space has been traversed for nearly four months by Jared Kushner, whom I first met about 18 months ago, when he introduced himself after a foreign policy lecture I had given. We have sporadically ­exchanged views since. As part of the Trump family, Jared is familiar with the intangibles of the President. As a graduate of Harvard and NYU, he has a broad education; as a businessman, a knowledge of administration. All this should help him make a success of his daunting role flying close to the sun. Kushner isn't the only member of the Trump team to get some lukewarm words about his job rather than himself. Former White House chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) wasn't exactly dispensing compliments to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. But Kissinger comes from the same party as the White House. The first paragraph above says nothing about Kushner, but instead about the job he faces. Let's take the rest sentence by sentence: “This space has been traversed for nearly four months by Jared Kushner, whom I first met about 18 months ago, when he introduced himself after a foreign policy lecture I had given. We have sporadically ­exchanged views since.” This is establishing familiarity — ostensibly so Kissinger can provide us some personal details or testimonials about Kushner that we may not be aware of. “As part of the Trump family, Jared is familiar with the intangibles of the President.” Okay, that's a benefit of being the guy's son-in-law, certainly. But it's also what you'd expect. “As a graduate of Harvard and NYU, he has a broad education … \" As do many people who are not on the list of Time's 100 most influential people. \" … as a businessman, a knowledge of administration.” politics the-fix Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

We seem to be working small to big here. “All this should help him make a success of his daunting role flying close to the sun.” This seems like half vote of confidence and half warning shot. Kissinger writes that the basic elements of Kushner's biography outlined above “should” help make him successful ... but also that he's taken on a “daunting role” — perhaps a nod to the many problems Kushner has been tasked with, including Middle East peace, the opioid epidemic and overhauling how government functions.

      "text" : "ALPHARETTA, Ga. — A gray mood has settled over conservative-leaning voters in some of the country’s most reliably Republican congressional districts, as the party’s stumbles in Washington demoralize them and leave lawmakers scrambling to energize would-be supporters in a series of off-year elections.While the next nationwide elections are not until 2018, Republicans have grown fearful that these voters are recoiling from what they see as lamentable conditions in Washington: a government entirely in Republican hands that has failed to deliver on fundamental goals like overhauling the health care system.Early missteps by President Trump and congressional leaders have weighed heavily on voters from the party’s more affluent wing, anchored in right-of-center suburbs around major cities in the South and Midwest. Never beloved in these precincts, Mr. Trump appears to be struggling to maintain support from certain voters who backed him last year mainly as a way of defeating Hillary Clinton.Interviews with Republican-leaning voters in four suburban districts — in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota and New Jersey — revealed a sour outlook on the party. These voters, mainly white professionals, say they expected far more in the way of results by now, given the Republican grip on power in the capital. In opinion polls, they consistently give Mr. Trump mediocre approval ratings, even as he remains solidly popular with lower-income whites.In the past, first-term presidents have suffered grievous losses in midterm elections, when their party’s voters have stayed home while the opposition party has marched to the barricades. Former President Barack Obama saw Democrats lose 63 House seats in 2010 after Republicans and disaffected independents stampeded to the polls and grumbling Democrats did not.It is too early to say if the same dynamic is afflicting Mr. Trump. But already, Republicans have strained to prop up their candidates in a pair of special House elections in the areas around Atlanta and Wichita, Kan., both in districts that have voted overwhelmingly Republican in past congressional races.Republicans spent nearly $100,000 in last-minute ads boosting Ron Estes, a candidate in Kansas, who won a relatively narrow victory Tuesday night as turnout from the party’s voters slumped. Wary national Democrats invested little money in the race, prompting criticism from activists seeking to fight Mr. Trump’s party on every possible front.Republicans may face a tougher test next week in Georgia, where both parties have poured millions into contesting the seat vacated by Tom Price, Mr. Trump’s new health and human services secretary. At a well-tended shopping mall outside Atlanta, Eric Riehm, 48, said he was beginning to question the point of casting his ballot for Republicans.“The vote seems to matter less and less, because nothing can be done, just like repealing Obamacare,” said Mr. Riehm, who works in information technology sales and voted for Mr. Trump.That malaise cuts across regional lines: In the New Jersey district held by Representative Leonard Lance, a Republican, Joe Boyle, 61, said he took a dim view of Mr. Trump but still hoped he would turn things around.Mr. Boyle, who said he usually votes Republican, faulted the party for failing to “do the homework” on health care, and criticized lawmakers for focusing on their own interests instead of forging bipartisan agreements.“It’s all about ‘me,’ not about the better good of the overall population,” said Mr. Boyle, who recently retired as a marketing executive at Johnson & Johnson. Of Mr. Trump, he added: “He’s a mess.”Where Democratic activists have flocked to off-season races, hustling to volunteer, donate money and quickly cast their ballots in early-voting periods, Republicans have seen no comparable energy on their side. They have taken special measures to drum up interest: In Kansas, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas held a last-minute rally to draw attention to the race, and Mr. Trump praised Mr. Estes on Twitter on Tuesday morning.But in an illustration of the rising frustration among rank-and-file Republicans, Mr. Cruz received his loudest ovation when he rebuked his own party. “We have a Republican president, we have a Republican House, we have a Republican Senate — how about we act like it!” he demanded.Mr. Estes ultimately won by 7 points, compared with a nearly 32-point victory margin last fall for the district’s previous congressman, Mike Pompeo, who now leads the C.I.A. And the enthusiasm gap between the parties was on vivid display: Mr. Estes won 62 percent fewer votes than Mr. Pompeo did last fall, while the Democratic vote was only 32 percent lower than in November.Should Republican voters remain so demoralized — and Democrats so fired up — it could imperil dozens of congressional seats that are usually safe. Midterm elections typically turn on which party is more enthusiastic about sending a message; in the past special elections have served as political omens, like when former Senator Scott Brown’s upset win in Massachusetts in 2010 foreshadowed a building conservative wave.Republican anxieties run deeper than just the House. The gloomy environment has hampered their recruiting in a number of Democratic-held Senate seats, alarming the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, according to Republican officials who have spoken to him, who insisted on anonymity to describe those conversations.Joel McElhannon, a Republican strategist in Georgia, said intraparty wounds from the presidential race remained raw in areas Republicans badly need to win, making it difficult for them to turn out their voters.“It makes it hard to energize the broader Republican base when there are still these unresolved conflicts,” said Mr. McElhannon, predicting: “You’ll see it in various suburbanized districts throughout the country.”Far from Atlanta, along the shoreline of Lake Minnetonka, Minn. — where the accents could scarcely be more different, but the taste in high-end cars and center-right politics is the same — voters in Representative Erik Paulsen’s Minneapolis-area district voiced a similar sense of unease.Mr. Paulsen has been re-elected easily since managing a victory the year Mr. Obama was first elected president. But Hillary Clinton won his district by 10 points in November, making it terrain that could turn competitive if centrist voters recoil from the G.O.P.That would mean a fleece-clad insurrection from the type of voters strolling along Lake Street in Wayzata or dropping off their dogs at the Lulu and Luigi grooming parlor, as Jackie Carley did with Tiny Bubbles and Viggo, two of her rescues.Ms. Carley, a self-described moderate, said she would be more likely to support a congressman who would slow or halt the president’s agenda.“I’m a Minnesota person so I don’t want to be rude, but I’m not a fan,” Ms. Carley, a 47-year-old-teacher, said of Mr. Trump.Others were less diplomatic.“It’s a mess,” said Gretchen Gilbertson, 51, a stay-at-home mother out walking her own dog, Pancake. “Congress can’t get anything done, and our president is a buffoon.”Ms. Gilbertson vowed to do whatever she could to send Mr. Trump a message of disapproval in next year’s election.Paul Anderson, a state senator from nearby Plymouth, Minn., said voters there would judge their congressman on his own record. But for Mr. Paulsen to win re-election, Mr. Anderson suggested, he would probably “have to separate himself at some point from Trump.”It remains to be seen if Democrats can fully exploit the turbulent environment. They hoped last fall that Mr. Trump’s unpopularity would drag down suburban-based Republican candidates across the country, but the party won full control of government. And Democrats may face a tricky balancing act if the explosion of energy on the left collides with the native sensitivities of the moderate-to-conservative districts they aim to win.Representative Josh Gottheimer, a moderate Democrat who captured a Republican-held seat in the New Jersey suburbs last November, said he believed even some conservatives would be “open-minded to voting for Democrats, with the right approach.”“You have to find a very middle-of-the-road approach and one that is not ideologically rigid on either side,” Mr. Gottheimer said. “People are so fired up on the left, too, you have to make sure you are responsive there as well.”In Georgia, the Democrat running for Congress, Jon Ossoff, has tried to walk that line, promising in ads to check Mr. Trump’s power, while also pledging to cut wasteful spending. He faces a fractious array of Republicans in an open primary on Tuesday.While the district easily re-elected Mr. Price, Mr. Trump barely carried it against Mrs. Clinton. Strolling briskly past Banana Republic and Orvis storefronts, Helen Thompson, 72, said she was dismayed that Republican disorder had endangered the seat.“I think the Republican Party needs to get together — they need to get their you-know-what together,” she said. “I love Donald Trump, but I just wish he’d keep his mouth shut sometimes and I wish he’d listen to the people who know what they’re doing.”Ms. Thompson, who worked at a brokerage firm before retiring, said she had voted early in the special election for Dan Moody, a former state senator, from a throng of candidates that includes Karen Handel, a former county commissioner in Fulton County, and Judson Hill, a former state senator. Other voters were less committed: Edward Holben, 62, an engineer on his way into Whole Foods, said he was not following the race closely but expected to vote Republican.Yet Mr. Holben said he was turned off by partisan rancor in Washington, and unsure of Mr. Trump’s ability to enact major legislation. He called the attempt to restructure the health care system so inept he was unsure Republicans were ever determined to pass it.“You want a five-star rating?” Mr. Holben asked of the Congress. “How about a thumbs-down?”",

Luxury brands and boutiquesAbai Schulze is one of these entrepreneurs. Her brand, Zaaf, sells a delectable range of handmade leather handbags and accessories. With an online store and stockists in Europe and the US, it's hard to believe that the business was started just over two years ago, or that Schulze -- who is 27-- grew up in an orphanage.Born in remote Gishen in northeastern Ethiopia, Schulze's life took a very different turn when she was adopted by an American family at age 11. That hard start would give her the desire to make change happen in her native Ethiopia. \"I grew up in Texas but always had the desire to come back and start a business,\" Schulze says. \"I knew I wanted to be in the creative space and create jobs in Ethiopia so Zaaf was a combination of passion and opportunity.\"Read MoreToday, Zaaf which means tree in Amharic, employs 17 people -- 10 of which are artisans -- but the team often swells to many times its size. \"We outsource when we have large orders,\" Schulze explains.Abai Shculze, founder of Ethiopian accessories brand ZaafSchulze and I meet at her workshop and recently-opened boutique in Addis. She has agreed to show me round her business but also to introduce me to other makers and entrepreneurs who are bucking the trend to simply export to mature markets in the West, chosing instead to also develop the market for their goods at home by opening retail spaces. With many jobs still being created in the informal economy Schulze also takes me to Addis Ababa's largest garment market, Shiro Meda.First we head to Snap Plaza, a new shopping centre on Bole road (an affluent part of town), to check out baby brand Little Gabies, and meet its founder Amelsa Yazew.Amelsa Yazew, (L) founder of baby boutique Little Gabies poses with Tensae who works in the shop.The gabi is the traditional handwoven Ethiopian blanket, and Yazew had the idea to start making a version for babies when she returned to Addis from New York and couldn't find a suitable baby blanket.\"Admittedly, as a new mom, I was overprotective and excited and on a mission to find a soft, cozy, natural and unique blanket I could rely on,\" Yazew says. After checking out what was already available on the market, Yazew decided to start her business when her baby Caleb was only three-months-old. The mompreneur, who still holds down a full-time job, launched in New York in 2014 and now creates jobs for 22 people. As well as the blankets (in cotton and a limited-edition cashmere), Little Gabies also sells baby shoes, headbands, nursing covers and beachwear.Traditional clothes at Shiro MedaNext Schulze and I head to Shiro Meda, where hundreds of vendors line the busy Entoto road and sell netela and habesha kemis -- traditional shawls and dresses from central and northern Ethiopia, most often made from shemma, a cotton cloth which is handwoven in long strips and sewn together, with a decorative border.\"Most Ethiopians will come here for their traditional wear,\" says Schulze. \"The designs are beautiful but it's not always the best craftsmanship so look closely before you buy.\"Abai Schulze haggles at Addis Ababa's large market for traditional Ethiopian clothes, Shiro Meda.To get the most from Shiro Meda, Schulze advices that shoppers compare prices before buying. It also helps to go with a local. Prices will differ depending on how complex the embroidery is, the quality of the cotton and the weaving -- the best cloth is tightly woven. As well as clothing, traders at Shiro Meda also sell arts and crafts, souvenirs, t-shirts and accessories. Contemporary arts and crafts market, AnbarAs we leave Shiro Meda -- with five scarves in hand -- I agree to check out Anbar Marketplace at the weekend where Schulze will be selling her bags, alongside dozens of other businesses catering to the growing middle class market, made up in large part of expats and Ethiopians returning from the diaspora. For this upmarket event that takes place on the grounds of the Addis Ababa Golf Club, I switch guides and I'm accompanied by an artist, writer and educator, Amira Ali.Writer and poet Amira Ali, checks out the crafts at Anbar MarketplaceFrom the moment we arrive Ali, who splits her time between her east African homeland and the west coast of the US, seems to know everybody. A lot of traders and consumers like Ali were members of the Ethiopian diaspora, predominantly in the States, who have returned to be part of their nation's success story. With more disposable income, these middle class Ethiopians were on the lookout for somewhere to meet and shop and Anbar Marketplace filled the gap. It also provides a service for the creative community -- helping to connect them with consumers.\"Addis needed an outdoor event space with great food and music,\" says Abeba Nerayo, one of the founders of Anbar. Nerayo launched Anbar in 2014 with three other friends and now have 80 vendors attend the bi-annual event. \"A lot of young artists who cannot afford shops but were making amazing stuff at home sell at Anbar,\" Nerayo adds.After paying the 50birr (little more than $2) entrance fee, shoppers can explore the white marquees. They house dressed trestle tables displaying a range of goods, from art, pottery, baskets, jewelry and candles, to fresh fruits, vegetables, Ethiopian wine and desserts made with teff, a super grain native to Ethiopia. There are also hot food stalls, notably the barbecue stand serving tibs and injera (sautéed seasoned beef strips and a spongy sourdough flatbread), conveniently located next to a delicious honey wine stand. The live band playing Ethiojazz hits rounds off the party atmosphere. This is retail therapy at its best.var id = '//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js'.replace(/\\s+/g, '');!!document.getElementById(id) || (function makeEmbedScript(d, id) (document, id)); Last day in #Addis wouldn't be complete without tibs: diced beef fried in Ethiopian butter and served with a hot sauce, spicy powder and injera (and white bread which was a little surplus to requirements). #addisababa #ethiopia #travel #weekend #ethiopianfood #injera #Africa #alfresco #foodporn #meatandbread #tasteintravel #visitafrica A photo posted by Eliza Anyangwe (@elizatookthis) on Nov 14, 2015 at 11:33am PSTRead more from African VoicesFollow @CNNAfrica\n!function(d,s,id)(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');",

      "text" : "For our first-ever Love issue, we asked four authors to recount times when love and travel intersected in their lives: Alexander Chee writes about a possible betrayal in Spain. Jami Attenberg recalls how a friendship deepened in Sicily. Sarah Hepola remembers a road trip – and an uncertain future – in Mexico. And Sloane Crosley looks back at a relationship that took three trips to kill (below).We also have six writers recounting transformative moments that happened while traveling; a roundup of new hotels and resorts for all kinds of relationships, and a collection of readers’ stories of loves found and lost on the road.When I met Max, he had just returned to New York from Los Angeles, where he had broken up with his long-distance girlfriend. We were attracted to each other, and so we proceeded to do some creative calculus, wherein, because he had been the break-er and not the break-ee, we could immediately start dating.This (practically fabricated!) relationship of his had even occurred in a different time zone, placing it squarely in the past.Max worked at a record label, and I worked in book publishing, and this is why people in the arts should not be trusted with complex equations.At first, everything was wonderful. We slept late, bought each other thoughtful gifts, met each other’s parents. At night, we went to shows for his bands or book parties for my authors, each of us gamely tolerating the rivers of unknown names and acronyms that flowed through the conversations. But by six months in, it was clear I was more invested. It was also clear neither of us wanted to address it.Most people in our situation buy plants or adopt animals or watch fiendish amounts of television. We bought plane tickets. Each time the opportunity arose for one of us to get out of town, the other followed, hoping that the change of scenery would change our dynamic. Yet each trip had the inverse effect: pushing us farther apart. So, why would I continue to get on a subway with this person, never mind board an airplane?I’m so glad you asked.First came Los Angeles. This was at a time when I was at the edge of illiteracy with L.A., and Max was at the edge of fluency. His attitude seemed to be, “It sure is brighter here.”Mine was something like, “Seventy-two suburbs in search of a city.”He booked us into the Le Parc Suite Hotel in West Hollywood, because of its proximity to the Troubadour, where one of his bands was playing. My only salient memory of the hotel is of standing in front of the bathroom mirror. We were getting ready to go to a birthday party at the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel, when Max appeared, looking me up and down as he had never done before. “People don’t dress up in L.A.,” he said.“I know,” I said, looking down at my skirt and heels. “It’s not like I haven’t been here.”But I hadn’t. Not really. I had not yet stayed in homes that I now know as well as my own or shared banter with a studio security guard or sat in traffic and told friends what to order without looking at the menu. I had a good hunch that Venice was only accessible by boat.Walking into the party wearing Chuck Taylors, I felt miscast in a play about a little girl trying to fit in. Was I competing with the memory of his former girlfriend or a whole city? Why compete with either?It didn’t help when we ran into her best friend, and Max looked as if he’d swallowed a boulder. It helped less when I ripped the side mirror off the rental car exiting a parking garage. After a meeting the next day, I got so lost, I pulled off Santa Monica Boulevard and started weeping. Maybe I would just live here now. In this car. On this corner. No friends, no love life, no career. Just these four doors and a bottle of Poland Spring.I confessed to Max that Los Angeles was making me feel unmoored and uncool. And by Los Angeles, I meant him. But this vulnerability fell on deaf ears. It’s not that Max wasn’t a good guy; he was a very good guy. It’s that the framework of Los Angeles seemed to exacerbate whatever wasn’t working in our relationship in New York. In theory, the nice thing about travel is that you never have to wonder if the feeling between you and the place you are visiting is mutual. But in practice, sentiment and scenery get muddled. This is why some people wind up with a surprising affection for Buffalo, and total disdain for Barcelona.That night, we watched the band in silence. After the show, Max asked me what I thought. I grumpily informed him it was the kind of music I might listen to while doing something else, like reading, or cleaning, or listening to better music. We slept along opposite edges of the bed. Never had I felt so distant from a person so close to me. I fell asleep certain that Los Angeles had done us in.Instead, we chalked it up to the trickery of the West.In retrospect, Los Angeles was a masochistic first trip. So, for New Year’s, we repacked our hopes and our sunglasses and headed to San Juan, P.R. Determined to prove my worth via my travel acumen, I sunk my teeth in. I had been there before, having gone midnight kayaking in the phosphorescent bays, and having found it to be transformative. I acquired a Puerto Rican flag bikini that was 70 percent polyester and 30 percent trying too hard. I picked the hotel, and made us a reservation at a restaurant in a converted mansion. But neither Max nor the couple who joined us felt much like kayaking through a rain forest full of mosquitoes. The bikini, meanwhile, gave me a rash, the restaurant turned out to be phenomenally expensive and the hotel featured a rooftop club thumping its music right through our ceiling. It was like sleeping in the heart of a jogging giant.On the beach on our last day, Max received a call from one of his singers, who had gotten engaged to an actress. The couple had met after Max and I got together. I don’t make a habit of idealizing celebrity marriages, but upon hearing the news I felt the need to take an overtly dramatic walk, so that I might gaze upon the bigness of the ocean and lecture myself about the perils of jealousy. If the tropics couldn’t make a couple out of us, what could? Travel is supposed to be taxing. Vacation itself — the being there — is not. The same with relationships: The work they require should be because you and your partner have different approaches to existing in a new place. It should not be because one of you refuses to leave the house.By the time we got to the airport, I had reverted to an embarrassingly naïve and inept version of myself. At the gate, Max turned to me and asked where my luggage had gone. I ran back to the ticket counter, where I had left my bag; an old woman was leaning on it, yelling at a T.S.A. agent. I gently wheeled it out from under her elbow. It is impossible to overstate how out of character this was. I have missed exactly one flight in my life, and it was because I mixed up the departure and arrival times. I don’t run late. I don’t leave phone chargers in hotel rooms. Given the chance, I’m pretty sure I could figure out how to circumnavigate the globe in 22 and a half hours. But with Max, I was perpetually out of place.“Should we just do this?” I asked, exasperated and sad. I thought it might mitigate the pain if we ripped off the Band-Aid outside the Continental United States. I was the one in love; certainly, I couldn’t be expected to do it. But by then, the boarding “process” (as though it’s a metamorphosis) had begun. Max grabbed my bag. Only a monster breaks up with someone on an airplane.Perhaps if we had gone to Reykjavik, Iceland, that would have expedited things. Cold locales force you to deal with what’s in front of you. They don’t demand that you slather yourself with positive thinking. Instead, like geniuses, we left for a weekend in Miami. I was coming from Maine, and there are no direct flights from Maine to Miami (a great disservice to the people of Maine). A storm grounded me in Philadelphia for four hours. When I arrived at the Standard in Miami Beach, exhausted, hungry and frizzy, I found Max sprawled on our bed, looking frightened after receiving a series of expletive-laced texts from me about my delay. But good news! He had made us dinner reservations at Prime 112.Prime 112 is a steakhouse. I haven’t eaten meat since I was a teenager. But, fine, I thought. O.K. Let’s go to the cow factory. Since Miami turned out to be our last trip together, you would think I would remember more of it. But this is how the world ends: with a whimper. I remember going to the Raleigh Hotel and drinking mojitos, something I have done both before and since with greater joy. I remember going to an art exhibit that was closed when we arrived. I remember Max test-running his “us” talk on a boardwalk. During a lull, he said, “Nice place to visit, but you wouldn’t want to live here, you know?” And I remember genuinely not knowing if he meant Miami or us.He ended it in New York. It hurt. Pointing out the elephant in the room doesn’t mean everything doesn’t get broken pushing the elephant out of the room. For a long time, I couldn’t so much as think of the places we had been. He took my favorite picture of me in San Juan, wearing a white dress and walking up a cobblestone alley surrounded by pastel houses. When I looked at the photo, all I saw was how far away he’d have to have been in order to take it. But then years passed and time redrew the map. I went to shows at the Troubadour. I booked Prime 112 for a friend’s bachelorette party. Plenty of fish and vegetable options. Max moved to Los Angeles, where he met his wife. The singer and the actress who had triggered my jealousy got divorced.A few months ago, I saw Max at the wedding of a mutual friend. I watched him make small talk with my boyfriend, both of them laughing and chatting away, as if it weren’t the craziest thing that had ever happened. But, of course, it wasn’t. Max and I are a specific variety of old friends: ones who went to many of the wrong places at the wrong time.On our way out, I told my boyfriend about our trips, marveling anew at what disasters they were. I struggled to remember the name of that restaurant in San Juan, eventually deciding that I didn’t want to remember. Some places, like some people, are meant to be left behind. It doesn’t mean you bear them ill will. If anything, it’s the reverse. The next time you stumble on a familiar cafe or street corner somewhere, take a moment to pay tribute to these landmarks of relationships past. After all, you are one of two tourists in the whole world who will ever know they are there.",

Photo by Ingram Publishing/Thinkstock. requirejs([\"jquery\"], function($) ); Advertisement Dear Prudence, My younger brother and I (he’s 28, I’m 30) were raised in an extremely conservative evangelical household. When he was 18, my brother tearfully confessed to me and my parents that he is gay. I told him I would support him no matter what, but my parents made him listen to lectures about how being gay is a sin, and how he could change if he really tried, and sent him to a “conversion therapy” camp. Since then, he has gone out with a series of young women and is planning on proposing to his current girlfriend. He appears happy on the surface, but to me, he seems broken and deflated, and I see no real joy in his relationships. It breaks my heart to see him so miserable. I’ve always tried to counter my parents’ preaching, but I’m worried it’s too late. She doesn’t know that he’s gay—my brother told me he’s never told her. Since all my pleas have fallen on deaf ears, I am wondering if you can tell me: Should I say something to his girlfriend? I am afraid that if he goes through with this proposal they will both be unhappy. I think telling his girlfriend about his confession might be the only way to save them. —Saving the Beard Subscribe to Prudie! I can’t quite see my way to saying, “Yes, you should out your deeply closeted, self-loathing brother.” That said, I feel a great deal of compassion for his girlfriend, especially as it seems likely that she has no idea the man she loves is gay. For what it’s worth, I believe that your read of the situation is accurate, that the conversion therapy your brother suffered as a teenager likely “cured” him of nothing but contributed to a great deal of pain and self-hatred, and that a marriage between your brother and his girlfriend according to their current understanding would be ill-advised. I think you should begin by appealing to your brother: “I love you so much, and I think the world of you just as you are, and it breaks my heart that you think you have to ‘fix’ the fact that you’re gay. I don’t think that you do. But I want to respect however you choose to live your life, and if you’ve decided you would rather marry a woman despite being attracted to men, I could find a way to support that if your relationship were not based on hiding this information from her. I don’t doubt that you care for her. If you two had decided to build a life together after she made an informed decision, that would be one thing, but I think you will only hurt both her and yourself if you try to start a marriage this way. I’m asking you as your sister—as someone who loves you and wants you to be happy, joyous, and freely and fully known by your partner—to please reconsider your decision to propose. This is a part of your life that she should know about, regardless of how you identify now, and if there’s any chance she could find out from some other source later in life, I think you’d rather she heard it first from you. You’re the best person to share this information with her.” You say that he hasn’t responded to your pleas in the past, so I’m aware this request may also go ignored, but it is absolutely worth saying, if only for your own conscience. If nothing else, at least one person in your brother’s life should be able to say, “I love you, and it’s OK that you’re gay, and I want you to know that.” Advertisement If worst comes to worst, and your brother never tells his girlfriend that he’s gay and they do get engaged, let him know that while you’re not going to out him or cut him off, you’re not going to actively help him lie to her either. You’ll have to determine for yourself what that compromise will look like and how much time you’ll be able to spend with them as a couple, but I urge you to remain an available and loving presence in your brother’s life—even if it’s at a distance—so that if the day ever comes that he does decide to come out again, he’ll have someone who can support him. * * * Dear Prudence: How do I politely inform my all-female office that women can pee on toilet seats, too? requirejs([ 'premium-panoply', 'css!../css/components/premium-panoply' ], function (premiumPanoply) ); Hear more Prudence at Slate.com/Prudiepod. Advertisement * * * Dear Prudence, My wife of 12 years and I were planning to have sex after a six- to eight-week hiatus (an all-too-regular and depressing reality). She and our son were watching YouTube videos together well past his bedtime. Later, she lectured me about how important it is to nurture moments with him and called me impatient for wanting to have sex instead. I said that I felt ignored and was frustrated with how rarely we have sex. It doesn’t seem like a priority for her. She said she understood my point of view (and that she wants a better sex life, too) but that there’s a long list of things I need to work on first to make her feel better about having sex with me. I admit there’s a lot I have to work on, but my needs are not being met. I can’t talk to her about it because it turns into a discussion about the laundry list of things she needs from me. I tell her what I want, but I don’t really feel like she’s listening. There is no spontaneity, she will never initiate sex, she frequently says no when I try, and our sex life is dying. I don’t know what to do. I’m depressed and considering ending my marriage. —Unfulfilled You two are approaching the same problem(s) with conflicting perspectives. Both of you are aware that your sex life is unsatisfying, that you’re not connecting or supporting one another emotionally, and that your current balance of household responsibilities isn’t working. Your primary concern is reconnecting sexually before talking about anything else; your wife can’t imagine having sex regularly again without addressing those other issues first. You two both want the same things but can’t imagine breaking the stalemate. Advertisement I confess I’m curious about the “laundry list” your wife presented you with. You admit that her requests are reasonable and in line with reality, but you seem to feel that you’re incapable of addressing any of them until you two start having sex regularly again. Why is that? How much sex would you want to have with her before you felt willing and able to change the behaviors you’ve both agreed aren’t working? Does a part of you believe that your wife is being dishonest and would not be prepared to meet you halfway if you tried to meet her requests? I can’t answer these questions for you without greater detail. Be honest with yourself and figure out what you’re afraid of that’s keeping you from trying. Before you end your marriage, consider couples counseling, where you two can discuss ways to approach this divide as a team rather than as two bitter opponents. You will likely both have to compromise in ways you would prefer not to, but that’s the nature of compromise, I’m afraid. The good news is that getting started is the hardest part. The more often you both try to meet the other in the middle, the easier and more rewarding it will get. * * * Dear Prudence, My fiancé and I are getting married next year and plan on inviting only close friends and family. My fiancé’s parents and my father are very generously splitting the costs of the wedding, and I asked them if they wanted to add a few people to our guest list as a token of my gratitude (they’re very reasonable people). I’m fine with everyone they added (about 10 people) except for my fiancé’s aunt. I’ve only met her twice, but according to my future in-laws, she’s a compulsive thief. His family hides their purses and valuables when she is invited to events. She was recently fired for stealing from her co-worker. Based on her past behavior, I think it’s likely she’ll steal from guests during the reception or even from the gift table. Is there a way I can gently push back on the request to include this person? She’s my fiancé’s father’s sister, and he says it’s up to us. My fiancé’s mother says we have to invite her. I love both of my future in-laws dearly, but I don’t want anything to go missing on our wedding day. Advertisement —Klepto at the Wedding Push back cheerfully and robustly. There’s no need to be gentle about it. You’ve already got your father-in-law on your side, and you don’t have to say anything other than this: “We’re happy to add to our guest list, but since Karabeth the Enigma has shown no interest in getting help for her compulsive stealing, we won’t be able to invite her. We don’t want to put our other guests at the risk of losing something valuable just because they wanted to attend our wedding.” Hold firm to that line and make no apologies for it. * * * Dear Prudence, My husband says he loves me and wants to stay with me, but it seems like I make him miserable. He is always angry or upset about something and won’t end things with his mistress, whom I really do not like (we’ve had an open relationship in the past but don’t now). She seems to make him happier than I do. I love it when he is happy and miss being the one who makes him happy. What can I do? —Can’t Make Him Happy Don’t pay attention to what your husband says, pay attention to what he does. He’s constantly angry, he’s impossible to please, he treats his girlfriend better than he treats you, and he refuses to honor the agreement of your no-longer-open marriage. This is not the behavior of a man who is in love. This question has a short answer, not because I’m trying to be flip or dismissive but because it’s a very simple problem: You can leave him, and figure out what makes you happy besides pleasing your selfish ex-husband. * * * Dear Prudence, My boyfriend and I recently had a conversation about masturbation. He said he doesn’t do it now that we are together, which surprised me. I assured him that if he wanted to, he could, with or without me and with or without porn being involved. He insisted he doesn’t need to, but he asked if I do. I said I do masturbate, and he acted like he was fine with it, but he now brings it up passive-aggressively and often asks which other guys or girls I think are hot. He says he’s joking, and even after I tell him I feel judged by these comments, he’ll only apologize in the moment before bringing it up again a few days later. What is that? What can I say to make him open up and have this conversation with me honestlyinstead of hinting he’s unhappy? And if he does, and he wants me to stop, is that even a reasonable request? Are there really couples that consider it cheating? Is it crazy if I break up with him over what is, I’ll admit, kind of a minor issue? He’s annoying me to no end! It is always OK to break up with someone who is annoying you to no end; that’s not a minor issue. Masturbation is not cheating, although, if individual couples want to mutually agree on particular masturbatory rules, they’re certainly free to. The key word there being, of course, mutually. It would be unreasonable of him to ask you to stop masturbating just because he doesn’t do it. Your boyfriend is not joking, and the next time he brings it up, call him on it. “You’ve started making snide comments and passive-aggressive jokes ever since I told you I masturbate. They’re clearly not ‘just jokes,’ and I’ve made it clear I don’t like it. Are you willing to talk about what’s really bothering you, or at least willing to stop jabbing me about it if you’re unwilling to have that conversation?” If he’s willing to talk, great; you two can work toward a common solution. If he’s not, you should probably break up with him. * * * A Slate Plus Special Feature: Help! My Crazy In-Laws Are Making Me Throw a Wedding I Don’t Want. Dear Prudence answers more of your questions—only for Slate Plus members. Dear Prudence, I’m a 34-year-old woman who’s been with my husband for 15 years. We have two children together, and he has two daughters from a previous relationship. I want to leave our marriage, primarily because I’ve felt unsupported for too long. Suffice it to say, our family has had a ton of significant life events over the past couple of years, and the brunt of keeping up with everything fell to me. I’ve been considering divorce for over six months already. I’m not rushing into anything and have talked with a counselor about this. I’m seeing another counselor next week just for a second opinion. My husband’s ex-wife is my only friend. She has, as well as my boss, brought up the word abusive when talking about my husband. He is extremely jealous and, at times, controlling. He wants to know exactly where I am, what I’m doing, why I have to work late, who is going to be wherever I’m going, stuff like that. He’s never physically harmed me, or called me names, or put me down, or withheld money from me, or any of the other things that I’ve seen named as common abusive behaviors. I’m a reasonably smart woman, but this has really stopped me in my tracks. How do you know if the behaviors are at the abusive level? How many behaviors does one need to exhibit, and with what frequency, before it rises to abuse? He used to be much more jealous and controlling than he is now, but if he’s controlling once a month versus daily or weekly, is that “abusive”? —Is It Abuse? Some of the behaviors you listed do fall under the rubric of emotional abuse (there are more indicators at the National Domestic Violence Hotline website), but it can be hard to determine exactly when a person who exhibits certain controlling, unhealthy behaviors crosses the line into full-on abuse. Bear in mind, too, that no one is abusive all of the time and that being “reasonably smart” does not have anything to do with whether you can recognize abusive behavior in the moment. Abuse works precisely because the people who employ it make sure their partners trusts them and want to believe the best about them. Very few people expect to be abused, so don’t let the fact that you feel surprised or uncertain about whether or not you’ve been abused by your partner convince you that it’s not possible. The fact that you consider your husband’s ex-wife to be your only friend is certainly troubling. Whether it’s because your husband has been successful at keeping you isolated from others or for other reasons, you need a support network now more than ever. If there are any family members or friends you’ve lost touch with but who you think would be willing to help you as you start divorce proceedings, reach out to them and let them know what’s been going on. Ultimately whether or not you choose to understand your soon-to-be-ex husband as a person who committed abuse against you, the most important part of your letter is this: “I want to leave our marriage.” Whether his jealousy and desire to monitor your whereabouts are borderline or fully abusive is something you will be able to further explore with your therapist in time. The important part to remember is that his behavior is controlling, destructive, unsupportive, and unloving, and that your marriage is over as a result of it. If you find the word abusive useful to you in processing the end of your marriage, you may choose to use it, even if only in therapy or in private conversations with trusted friends. But he does not have to be an abuser in order for divorce to be the right choice for you. Discuss this column with Dear Prudence on her Facebook page!

      "text" : "Another candidate has joined the growing list of those vying for the Democratic nomination to challenge Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) next year. Lindsey Davis Stover, a communications strategist and former Obama administration official from McLean, launched a campaign website Tuesday and said she will file the paperwork to begin fundraising. She is part of a flood of first-time candidates seeking public office to counter President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. Davis Stover said Comstock has voted in lock-step with the Trump administration’s priorities “and has been completely out of touch with our district.” “She’s even been afraid to hold a town hall meeting. I just think the 10th District deserves someone who will stand up to Donald Trump and put our needs first,” she said in an interview. Daniel Helmer, an Army veteran, and Kimberly Adams, past president of the Fairfax teacher’s union, have announced their candidacies, and many others, including state Sen. Jennifer T. Wexton (D-Loudoun), are weighing runs. Comstock is a formidable campaigner who last year outperformed Trump by 16 points to win a second term in a Northern Virginia district that spans the Washington suburbs and conservative counties on the West Virginia border. The race is a top target of national Democratic groups, which say they have a chance to win the well-educated, diverse voters of Loudoun County. Comstock reported raising $506,891 in the first quarter of this year and has $428,506 cash on hand. During last year’s campaign, Davis Stover hosted weekly phone banks at her home for the coordinated campaign of Comstock’s challenger, LuAnn Bennett, and Hillary Clinton. Davis Stover criticized Comstock for stating her opposition to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s plan to replace the Affordable Care Act when it looked as if it would fail; Republicans later pulled the bill from the floor. “Her decision was made when the fate of the bill was already sealed,” she said. “I don’t believe that’s courage — that’s politics, and that’s exactly what people are sick of.” Through a spokesman, Comstock declined to respond to Davis Stover’s candidacy and comments. Davis Stover, 38, grew up in Houston and graduated from Baylor University with a bachelor’s degree in public policy and communications. After college, she was an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer and earned the first of two master’s degrees at Baylor. From there, she went to work for congressman Chet Edwards, who was a member of the House of Representatives,, and rose to chief of staff.

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — When President Trump’s new Middle East envoy began haggling over the details of an agreement with Israel to curb construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, they turned to a politically improbable adviser: Yael Lempert, a 43-year-old diplomat who worked on the issue in Barack Obama’s White House.When Mr. Trump met with the leaders of Japan, Britain and Canada, he included Thomas A. Shannon Jr., another career diplomat, who rose to the No. 3 post in Mr. Obama’s State Department. And when Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson traveled to Turkey this past week to rally support for the military campaign against the Islamic State, he took along Brett H. McGurk, who coordinated that effort as Mr. Obama’s special envoy.These diplomats are part of a rare cohort in the Trump administration: holdovers from the Obama years, whose skills, knowledge and bureaucratic finesse have enabled them to survive, even thrive, in an administration determined to purge all vestiges of its predecessor.Anytime there is a change in administrations, career government officials face a tricky transition. But that process has been particularly difficult under Mr. Trump, because of the insurgent nature of his campaign and his deep suspicion of the permanent bureaucracy.While these diplomats have held on through multiple transfers of power in Washington, navigating this new administration poses special challenges. Ms. Lempert has come under fire from people on the Israeli right, who accuse her of continuing to push Mr. Obama’s tough-on-Israel policies. And Mr. Shannon’s ability to get along with Mr. Trump’s inner circle has rankled some in the State Department, which has become a hotbed of dissent against the new president and his policies.“They’re relying on these people for sheer expertise,” said Elliott Abrams, a Republican foreign-policy elder who was briefly considered for the post of deputy secretary of state. “But there is a danger here. You have to make a judgment about whether the career person was so embedded in the previous administration that they need to go immediately.”The status of Obama holdovers remains a source of tension within the National Security Council. Since the inauguration in January, Mr. Trump’s aides have pushed to get rid of many of them, in part because they question whether people who worked for Mr. Obama can be loyal to Mr. Trump. It is unclear whether the new national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, is resisting these efforts, though he has made a point of meeting with the career staff.The problem is compounded by severe delays at the White House in filling jobs. So far, it has nominated people for only 43 of 553 key executive branch positions, according to a tally by the nonpartisan Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.The delays are particularly acute in the national security field, where the White House is confronting crises like the military campaign against the Islamic State. Even before his secretary of state, Mr. Tillerson, was confirmed, Mr. Trump had signed an executive order barring visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries and moved to revive peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.The travel ban thrust Mr. Shannon, whose title is under secretary of state for political affairs but who was then serving as acting secretary of state, into an awkward spot. The White House barely consulted the State Department before issuing the order, and it relied on Mr. Shannon to rally his colleagues — many of whom bitterly opposed the order — to enforce it.White House officials, some of whom had expected the State Department to actively undermine the president, said they were surprised by the speed with which it issued instructions to consular offices worldwide. They credit Mr. Shannon, 59, with overseeing that response.“He was a rock” that weekend, said Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist. “Really came to the forefront with leadership, judgment and class. Folks think very highly of him.”Mr. Shannon also stood in for Mr. Tillerson in the president’s meetings with Prime Ministers Theresa May of Britain, Shinzo Abe of Japan and Justin Trudeau of Canada. At the news conferences in the East Room after those meetings, he was the lone outsider who sat with Mr. Bannon and other members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle.In all these cases, Mr. Shannon said, he was simply doing his job as a Foreign Service officer. “We take an oath to the Constitution, and that Constitution is all about respect for our laws and for the will of our people,” he said. “We have to respect the decision of the American people.”A 34-year veteran of the Foreign Service, Mr. Shannon served in the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, where he became a favorite of Mr. Bush’s secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. He also served as assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs under Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, a job in which he won the trust of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.“I am not the least bit surprised he is one of the last men standing,” said Daniel Restrepo, a former senior director in the National Security Council who worked with Mr. Shannon. “He’s both an effective diplomat and an effective bureaucrat, with an agreeable personality.”Arturo Valenzuela, who succeeded him as assistant secretary, noted that Mr. Shannon was a fan of Nascar. That helps give him a common touch, which Mr. Valenzuela said might appeal to the people in Mr. Trump’s circle, even though he has a doctorate in history from Oxford.Certainly, Mr. Shannon has built bridges to Mr. Tillerson, who recently asked him to stay on as under secretary, traditionally the highest-ranking post for a career diplomat.For Ms. Lempert, who has been posted to Jerusalem and advised Mrs. Clinton’s cabinet successor, John Kerry, on his dealings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, the appeal to Mr. Trump’s advisers was her experience in the complex, trap-filled world of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Her colleagues say she is well connected on both sides and is viewed as an honest broker (though in Israel, critics fault her for what they say was her role in Mr. Obama’s campaign to pressure Mr. Netanyahu to freeze settlements).As it happens, Mr. Trump — through his special envoy, Jason D. Greenblatt — is now pushing the Israeli leader to slow down construction as well. And Mr. Greenblatt, a lawyer who worked for the Trump Organization and has no experience in Middle East diplomacy, decided to keep Ms. Lempert on to advise him on the ins and outs of that negotiation.Ms. Lempert, who is Jewish and also served in the Bush administration, played a major role in negotiating a $38 billion military aid package for Israel on behalf of the Obama administration.Still, after reports surfaced that Mr. Netanyahu’s aides were suspicious of her involvement in the talks, the prime minister’s office felt obliged to issue a statement saying it had no objection to her.Mr. Greenblatt, in a statement, said, “I have been ably supported by the extremely hard-working officials at the National Security Council (including N.S.C. Senior Director Yael Lempert).” She declined to comment, as did colleagues from the Obama administration. Some said they worried that praise from them would hurt her with her new bosses.A few of Mr. McGurk’s former colleagues demurred from commenting for the same reason. But of all the Obama holdovers, he has had perhaps the smoothest transition. In part, that is because Mr. McGurk, 43, has been working on Iraq and related issues through three administrations. He also clerked for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, which Republicans view as a valuable credential.This past week, he was at Mr. Tillerson’s side in the Turkish capital, Ankara, advising him on the bewildering politics of the 68-member coalition against the Islamic State. The United States plans to use a combined force of Arab and Kurdish forces to mount an assault on Raqqa, the Islamic State stronghold in Syria. But the Turks, who are fighting Kurdish militants at home, are balking because they view the Kurdish units as terrorists.Mr. McGurk organized a recent meeting of coalition members in Washington. In addition to his network of contacts in the region, he has forged close ties to the Pentagon, including to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.“By virtue of his experience, he has almost impossible-to-replicate, case-specific knowledge,” said Peter D. Feaver, who worked with Mr. McGurk in the Bush-era National Security Council. “In Brett’s case, he has proven he can be a loyal team player on very different teams.”",

Email it to us at: AskTheExpert@northwesternmutual.com The following is an excerpt from our Ask the Financial Expert podcast (listen to the entire podcast below): Mark: We’re heading into real estate peak season, so I want to get your thoughts on a few things related to real estate and housing. First question, how’s the housing market shaping up this year? Are we seeing growth? What’s going on?\nRon: We’re having a bit of a hiccup at the moment. Housing starts in March were down just shy of 7 percent1 over February, but the permit situation is still very solid. I think the drop in housing starts had more to do with the weather than anything else, so we’re not totally surprised. I think, in general, affordability has been good; and I think that overall the market continues to be reasonably strong.\nBrent: We are seeing a shortage of existing homes for sale, so the supply is down; and over time that should push new home sales to move higher. That should have a bigger multiplier effect on economic growth in the U.S. because new home sales take more to create than just selling existing homes.\nRon: I would also note that listings are lower in certain parts of the country. For instance, if you look at San Francisco, Denver, Boston, you’re seeing sort of a shortage. As a result, you’re starting to see prices being bid up in a number of those places.\nMark: When you look at demographics, who owns these homes?\nRon: It tends to be older people, and that has been a trend that we’ve been seeing. People over 65 have the highest percentage of home ownership right now2, and that trend keeps moving up. The rate overall for the population is about 63 percent, but it’s down from about 69 percent in 2004.\nMark: What impact would rising interest rates have on what’s going on?\nRon: Everyone has different views. I tend to think that the overall level of rates is low enough right now. The changes we’re seeing are too small to have a huge impact. The fact is that housing is affordable, and it still will be affordable even if rates go up another 50 basis points.\nBrent: Housing affordability is still high. If you look at a chart of the housing affordability index3, it’s well above where it was for most of the prior 20 or 30 years except for right after the great recession. Additionally, if rates rise, we’d assume that economic growth will be rising along with it—and wage growth, also.\nMark: To sum up, any other final thoughts on housing and the real estate markets?\nRon: The small moves that we’re seeing are less important than the overall trend. And the overall trends, not just for housing but across the economy, still look good.\nBrent: One additional point is that, post-recession, more people are going with fixed mortgages, which means more mortgages today are fixed than what they were in the past. That speaks to housing affordability because it suggests that people feel like they don’t have to stretch for the lower rate and take on the risk of it going higher. They feel they can lock their rate in longer. It will prevent some of the problems that hurt the housing market in the past.\nRon: It’s a very healthy trend.\nHear more from Ron, Brent and Mark in the “Ask the Financial Expert” podcast: Do you have a question for our financial experts?

      "text" : "TOKYO — Vice President Pence warned North Korea on Monday not to test U.S. military might by pursuing its nuclear weapons program, citing recent strikes in Syria and Afghanistan as proof of American “strength and resolve.” The stark warning, delivered in Seoul after the vice president went to the military demarcation line that separates the two Koreas, could revive speculation that the White House is considering military action against the regime in Pyongyang. Pence said the Trump administration wants to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons “through peaceful means,” but he repeated the administration’s warning that “all options are on the table.” In Washington, President Trump told CNN at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll that North Korea has “gotta behave.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump would not be “drawing red lines in the sand” with North Korea. 1 of 21 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × EmbedCopyShare The Trump administration: Moments that made headlines View Photos White House and Cabinet officials left strong impressions in the early days of the administration. Caption White House and Cabinet officials left strong impressions in the early days of the administration. Vice President Pence tells North Korea not to test American resolve Vice President Pence warned North Korea on April 17 that it could be in for the same treatment as Syria and Afghanistan — both of which the Trump administration has bombed this month — if it continues with its nuclear program. The stark warning, delivered in Seoul after the vice president went to the military demarcation that separates the two Koreas, could revive speculation that the White House is considering military action against the regime in Pyongyang. READ THE STORY Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. .wp-volt-gal-preroll-video “He holds his cards close to the vest, and I think you’re not going to see him telegraphing how he’s going to respond to any military or other situation going forward,” Spicer said. “I think that the action that he took in Syria shows that when appropriate, this president will take decisive action.” Spicer later cautioned reporters not to “make too much” of an analogy between Syria and North Korea. A State Department official said Monday that the United States will continue trying to further isolate North Korea economically, politically and diplomatically. The pressure will keep ratcheting up until Pyongyang stops conducting missile tests and demonstrates it is willing to engage in negotiations, said Susan Thornton, the acting assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs. “We’re looking for some kind of signal that they realize the current status quo is unsustainable,” she said. “They have to make a final decision about getting rid of illegal programs in order to turn the page and have a more normal relationship with the international community.” “We have not seen that signal,” she added. Pence arrived in South Korea just hours after North Korea launched its latest ballistic missile — which exploded within a few seconds — and amid a weekend of fanfare in North Korea, during which the regime showed off what appeared to be new missiles designed to reach the United States. There, during a trip to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea and later in remarks to journalists, he issued strong warnings to Pyongyang. Pence says 'all options are on the table' for North Korea Embed Copy Share Play Video1:29 (Reuters) A day after North Korea's most recent attempt to launch a rocket, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visits the demilitarized border between North and South Korea. A day after North Korea's most recent attempt to launch a rocket, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visits the demilitarized border between North and South Korea. (Reuters) “Just in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan,” Pence said after delivering a statement to the media alongside Hwang Kyo-ahn, South Korea’s acting president. Neither took questions. “North Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region,” Pence said. [N. Korea didn’t test a nuclear weapon, but it did try to launch another missile] Earlier this month, on Trump’s command, the U.S. military launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian military airfield in retaliation for a chemical attack that killed scores of civilians. Then, less than a week later, the U.S. military dropped a 22,000-pound bomb — the largest non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat by the United States — on Islamic State forces in eastern Afghanistan. With Kim Jong Un’s regime conducting a steady stream of ballistic missile launches and signs of activity around its nuclear test site, the Trump administration has raised the rhetoric on possible military action to stop it in its tracks. But any strikes against the North would likely bring the United States into a diplomatic crisis with China, the North’s main economic lifeline. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang called for international talks with North Korea to ease tensions. Russia, too, warned that the Trump administration was on what Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called a “very risky path.” “I hope there will be no unilateral actions like those we saw recently in Syria,” Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. Both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who visited South Korea last month, and Pence have stated that “strategic patience” — the Obama-era policy of putting pressure on North Korea and waiting for it to return to negotiations — is over and that military action is an option to make North Korea desist. The U.S. Navy’s decision to reroute an aircraft carrier strike group to the Korean Peninsula region as tensions mounted fueled speculation that the Trump administration might carry out a preemptive strike on North Korean military facilities. “As our secretary of defense made clear here in South Korea not that long ago,” Pence said Monday, “we will defeat any attack, and we will meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective response.” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Seoul in February. [North Korea’s 5 nuclear tests and how Washington has responded] Hwang, the acting president until the election to replace Park Geun-hye, said South Korea would “ensure the early deployment and operation” of an American-backed anti-ballistic missile system called Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). The plan has been controversial in South Korea, with some worried that it would make the South more of a target for North Korean missiles and others concerned about economic revenge being exacted by China. The front-runner to replace Park in a snap presidential election to be held May 9, progressive politician Moon Jae-in, has promised to review the previous government’s decision to host THAAD. [North Korea’s display of new missiles is worrying, analysts say] Beijing strongly objects to the antimissile system because it worries that the United States will use its batteries’ associated radar to snoop on China. China has imposed a painful economic boycott on South Korean exports and is making life difficult for South Korean companies in China. Pence said the United States will press ahead with the THAAD deployment and chastised China for its efforts to put pressure on South Korea to change its mind. “The United States is troubled by China’s economic retaliation against South Korea for taking appropriate steps to defend itself,” he said. “The better path would be for China to address the North Korean threat that is actually making such defensive measures necessary. “While issues like [THAAD] remain, the president and I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea, but as President Trump made clear just a few short days ago, if China is unable to deal with North Korea, the United States and our allies will,” the vice president said. world asia_pacific Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

Give up: I have four children—a son by my ex-wife and three daughters with my current one. My son was raised by his mother and completely indulged by her. It has always been a huge source of conflict between us. My son graduated high school a happy C-level student but was able to get into a good school. I paid for his first semester. He failed all but one of his classes. I wanted him to come back home and try community college rather than continue to waste my money. We all fought but came to an agreement that if he actually buckled down and got decent grades I would continue to do support him. This spring he seemed to do so. He sent me proof with his tests and essays. I really prayed he was turning his life around. Then over spring break, he got drunk, stole his grandmother’s car and destroyed it. We did not file charges but told my ex and my son that this was it in terms of financial support. My wife and I have worked long and hard to give all our children a chance at a good education and a better life. My daughter will be graduating in May with a 4.0 and a partial scholarship to an excellent school across the country. Her sisters will be graduating in the next two years. My son will have wasted over $25,000. I can’t afford to throw good money after bad. My son responded by calling my wife and his sisters “bitches” and cussing me out. My ex repeatedly tells me how much of a failure I am as a father and how I “threw away my only boy.” My wife told me I have done all I could do and more than I should have. Part of me agrees with her but part of me wonders. I love my son and I continue to love my son but I feel like I have failed him. I don’t know what else to do now—he is a grown man and has taken every chance life has given him and pissed it away. What do I do with this? Is there anything I can? Subscribe to Prudie! A: It is possible that you have, in significant and unalterable ways, failed your son, but it does not necessarily follow that you are now obligated to continue to pay for his schooling if he is incapable or unwilling to discharge his responsibilities as a student, nor does it make you an irredeemable “failure” of a parent. If you two are ever going to be able to honestly discuss your limitations as a parent, or the pain he may have experienced as a child, those conversations will have to be predicated on basic respect, not by calling your other children, who are entirely blameless, “bitches.” Your offer to pay for community college was a reasonable one, and you are not being unduly cruel or vindictive in withdrawing financial support given his recent destructive behavior. You may not have been as present a father as you could have been in the past, but you are decidedly not “throwing him away” now, and if your ex-wife continues to accuse you of doing so, feel free to respectfully but firmly end the conversation. Consider what you are willing to do for your son now, whether that be meeting to discuss your relationship, attending counseling sessions together, or helping him seek treatment. You can offer him a new kind of support as he continues to move into adulthood and remain available whether or not he seems interested in it at present. You can take responsibility for your own limitations and mistakes as a parent without taking responsibility for his current choices—you are not the reason he stole and crashed his grandmother’s car. If he continues to lash out or blame your other children for his current problems, you’re not obligated to act as a punching bag. Let him know the door is always open if he wants to reconnect, but that you’re not going to give him any more money or let him insult the rest of your family. This is painful but necessary work—you’re not going to fix the mistakes of the past by letting your son mistreat you and your other children now. Advertisement Q. Handouts: Yesterday my boyfriend’s mother offered to pay for some classes in cake decorating for me so that I can further my experience in baking to get a better job. I’m unemployed looking for a bakery job right now, which is why she offered to pay, and she wants me to pay her back by doing housework for her over the weekends. As much as I would love to take this opportunity, our relationship has been strained because of the circumstances of how her son and I came to be. I’m scared that she’ll pay for the classes and then somehow hold this over my head. I’m afraid to talk to my boyfriend about this because I don’t want to stress him out because it is his mother. Do I take hold of this opportunity and deal with what may come with her or do I find a way to pay for it myself? A: If you’re suspicious that this quid-pro-quo-not-quite-a-gift is going to come with serious strings attached, you shouldn’t accept it. If you think your boyfriend would be emotionally incapable of even discussing his mother’s offer to you, then you definitely shouldn’t accept it. If your boyfriend’s mother wants you to become her unofficial housecleaner in exchange for cake-decorating classes, you should run in the other direction. Better to find a job at a bakery washing dishes and ask for on-the-job training, or look for a baking apprenticeship, than to enter into a housecleaning-for-baking-classes exchange with a woman you have a strained relationship with. Thank her for the offer, but look for other, smaller ways to establish a better rapport with your boyfriend’s mother. Q. Renting to family: My parents had an old beach house that was in danger of foreclosure. Rather than lose this place that has been in the family over 15 years, my husband and I bought it from my parents. At the time, we asked my siblings if they wanted to go into this with us. They declined. We paid off the house and invested over $10,000 to update the beach house and rent it out. Frankly it was a good investment because the area exploded and during peak times we can get over $2,000 a week for it. My family has been over many times in the five years since we fixed up the place. We spent several holidays together but always with us. Now my niece wants to come down with a pack of her college friends and stay for the week right in the middle of summer. We had already rented the beach house out until the end of August. I told my niece her dates didn’t work and offered her the last dates for $500. This caused a ruckus. My sister called me to yell at me for daring to charge family, that the beach house apparently belonged to everyone, and how greedy I was being. I told her point blank the beach house was mine. We were the ones who put money, work, and sweat into the place. Everyone else was willing to let it go to the bank. At this point everyone in the family is involved. My mother wants peace, two siblings are on my side, one on my sister’s, and my husband is this close to wanting to sell and buy another beach house to spite the lot of them. Is there anything I can do to end this? A: The beach house does not belong to everyone in the family; the beach house belongs to you and your husband, primarily due to the fact that you purchased it and the rest of the family did not. You offered your siblings a fair opportunity to purchase the house jointly and they declined. You offered your niece a reasonable price for a vacation rental—less than $100 a night, less still if the cost were split evenly among her and her friends—and she declined. I don’t advise you to purchase another home out of spite, but there’s no reason for you to apologize or offer your relatives free use of your beach house. Stay calm, but hold your ground, and if you continue to receive furious phone calls, feel free to end the conversation: “We invested a lot of money into this property, and we rent it out when we’re not using it as part of our income. If anyone would like to stay at the beach house, we’re happy to offer a reasonable price to offset the cost of upkeep and cleaning, but it’s not available for free. If you’d rather stay elsewhere, we understand, but the matter is closed.” Advertisement Q. The agony of art: My wife and I recently moved back to the city where I went to school and I have reconnected with an old friend “Bill.” “Bill” is married to “Margie,” and we often have dinners as a foursome. Margie is a wannabe novelist who spends a lot of her time speaking about the Agony of Being an Artist. The first time we went out she literally said “Being a Writer I have one less layer of skin than other people.” The thing is Prudie, I am, if not a Writer, then certainly a writer. I’ve written five books for a well-known publisher under a female pen name and they are selling well (think vampires and bit of romance). When the kids were little, I used to write at the kitchen table. Now I get up early and write before going to work. It’s fun and I enjoy it. There is no agony in my world. The problem is my wife. She says things like. “Next time we are out with Bill and Margie I am going to take a bag of your books along and if that little twit starts agonizing about being a writer I’m going to take them out and bang them on the table.” How should we deal with my good-natured friend and his Tortured Artist wife? A: If your wife were to bang your books on the table, I have no doubt that Margie would respond not with, “My God, being a writer isn’t that difficult after all—I’ve been making so much extra work for myself!” but “Well, you’re not an artist like I am, merely a competent journeyman; this is why your pedestrian little romance novels don’t keep you up at night, tearing out your hair and rending your garments. How lucky you are to have the soul of a grocer and not a sensitive aesthete.” The best response to Margie’s ceaseless groaning is cheery disinterest: “I’m sorry to hear that! Hope things get better soon. What else is new with you two?” If it becomes absolutely impossible to deter her from making her miserable work life the sole topic of conversation, you can make more explicit requests to change the subject; if that doesn’t work, find other couples to have dinner with and scale back on your interactions with Bill and Margie. Let her miserable sonata fade into the background of your life, rather than buying front-row seats three or four nights a week. Q. Re: Handouts: I got a part-time job at a grocery store bakery, and I was taught how to decorate the cakes there. It’s a good beginning step toward a better job, and you get paid. A: Helpful point!

Q. Third wheel, two faces: I’ve been close friends with “Sara” since we were 12. Our friendship survived difficult adolescent times for both of us, including a painful crush I had on her while still in the closet. The crush is long gone, we’ve both become happy and successful, and we’ve built a healthy, supportive adult friendship. She came to visit me recently, and I introduced her to my good friend “Brian,” thinking they’d get along. Sparks flew, they’re now dating long distance, and I’m thrilled because they’re both so happy about it. The problem is Brian. He’s usually one of my kindest friends, but he’s suddenly become rude to me, to the point of being cruel. He made fun of my teenage struggles with my sexuality, which I told him never to do again. He apologized but is still making cutting remarks about everything from the quality of my Ph.D. work to how he “has to” stay friends with me because of Sara. I think he’s threatened by my long friendship with his new girlfriend, but I don’t know how to make him stop treating me this way. How do I talk to him? A: “Brian, you’re normally a good friend to me and that’s why your behavior over the last few months has come as such a surprise. You’ve started making cruel comments about my sexuality, the quality of my work, and the fact that you think of our friendship as something you ‘have to’ maintain, rather than something you enjoy. What’s going on? Can you explain what’s changed, and why you would say these things to me?” If he’s able to acknowledge his behavior and offer a genuine apology, as well as a vision for how he’ll behave differently in the future, you two may be able to see your way forward. If he claims not to know what you’re talking about or offers a series of flimsy excuses, your friendship may already be at an end. Advertisement Q. The slow fade: I grew up in a chaotic household with emotionally abusive parents (neglect, gaslighting, manipulation, lying, outbursts, tantrums). I have done a lot of work as an adult to work through this, including moving far away from abusive family members and seeing a mental health professional, and have set boundaries on how much time I spend with or contact them. I recently traveled to my hometown for the first time in over a year for my cousin’s wedding, and it went poorly. It was very triggering for me, and I had a panic attack at the thought of having to go over to their house one more time before I left. My partner and best friend convinced me not to go and helped me delicately excuse myself from the visit. Despite having a loving, supportive partner with me, it was still incredibly challenging being there. I am now wondering whether or not I want to keep these people in my life, even with limited contact. I know you have given some people the go-ahead to cut abusive people out, but what do you say about doing the slow fade out? Do I owe them any explanation for why I don’t want them in my life anymore, or can I just slowly disappear while focusing on my happy life elsewhere? For what it’s worth, any attempt at talking about the abuse has been met with explosive tantrums on their behalf—screaming, crying, slamming doors. A: You can absolutely fade out on your abusive family members. Anyone who makes a habit out of screaming and slamming doors has already declined to participate in civil, honest conversation. You do not need to invite them to continue to belittle you, and you know that trying to explain why you don’t want to speak to them would only lay the groundwork for additional abuse. Feel free to be a little busier than usual when they call, and don’t feel like you’re being dishonest or denying them the opportunity to change. Your parents have already demonstrated that, as they are now, they are incapable of hearing anything you have to say about their abusive behavior and responding with anything resembling rationality or open-mindedness. The kind of conversation that you cannot imagine having with them is already impossible under current conditions. Fade out on them for as long as you need to, even if that means the rest of their lives. Focus on your own health and your happy life, and don’t look back. Q. Sister loves dog more than baby: My sister is always making comments like “I like my two-legged baby, but I love my four-legged baby!” and lavishing her dog with attention while complaining that her 11-month-old daughter doesn’t appreciate her. Compounding matters, the dog is an absolute jerk. Snaps at people, defecates indoors, knows no boundaries. My sister mocks her baby when she cries and keeps her confined in a play yard most of the time. Meanwhile, she spends thousands of dollars and a ridiculous amount of time entering her dog in competitions. The baby is brought along but kept in her carrier the whole time. My niece’s basic necessities are being met, but she’s treated like a second-class citizen next to the dog, because “the dog was here first ... and she loves me.” Is this lack of bonding with her baby some kind of postpartum depression? How can I suggest she get help? A: This is deeply disturbing behavior; I don’t know enough about postpartum depression to judge whether or not this is a sign that your sister is unwell, but your impulse to tell her she needs help is a sound one. It’s heartening that your sister’s baby is getting her basic needs met, but if she’s spending most of her time locked up in a playpen, she’s likely not receiving anywhere near the sort of touch and attention she needs. To whatever extent you are able, whenever you’re with your sister, try to be as affectionate and attentive to her child as possible. Speak to your sister about your concerns immediately—tell her you’re deeply concerned that she mocks her baby for crying, that she resents an 11-month-old for not “appreciating” her, and that she keeps her in a playpen most of the day—and encourage her to make an appointment with her doctor to discuss the possibility of postpartum depression. The dog is a bit of a red herring; the way your sister treats her child is upsetting enough on its own, and it sounds like she’s the type who would bristle at any mention of her dog’s elevated place in the family. The most effective strategy, I think, is to focus on your concerns about the baby without triggering your sister’s protectiveness for her dog. Advertisement Q. Delay delay delay: I have been engaged for going on three years in May after dating for 11 years. After two years of waiting for a date I finally threw my hands in the air and said “no more” and pushed all the planning to my boyfriend. The problem seems to be that he wants his family present for this, but they are nonresponsive to coming out here for this event (they live in Chicago; we live in Montana). They all go on vacations every year and in the 20 years that he’s lived here they have been here three times. I’m a little tired of waiting and my son graduates from college next year and I don’t want to cram all these events into one summer. How can I get him to finally get with his family and explain to them that he wants to get married here and he wants them here and it really hurts his feelings that he’s been in all his siblings weddings but they won’t participate in his? It seems to me that if he asks they should show up, right? Top Comment If a guy wants to marry you, he will marry you. If a guy doesn't want to marry you, he waits 11+ years, then says things like \"My family doesn't want to fly out here. So we can't.\" More... 1.5k Comments Join In A: If you would like to get married this summer, then you should set a date with your fiancé. Then send invitations to his family members; if they seem undecided over whether to attend your wedding or take a vacation somewhere else, you can encourage him to have a conversation where he stresses how important their presence would be to him. It’s not, however, a conversation you can force him to have if he’s not interested in it, nor is it one that you can have for him. You two have been together for 14 years, and people get married without their entire extended families present. If it’s important to you to get married this year, then make it a priority, with or without his family present, and decide whether you are willing to end the relationship if you believe your boyfriend is dragging his feet because he doesn’t really want to get married.

      "text" : "Democrat Jon Ossoff is projected to advance to a runoff in Georgia's special election after failing to clinch a majority of the vote on Tuesday in order to avoid another election in late June. Ossoff led the crowded 18-candidate field in Tuesday’s “jungle primary” to fill the seat vacated by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. But since he didn’t clear the 50 percent threshold, he will now compete in a runoff with the second-place finisher, Republican Karen Handel, on June 20. Democratic hopes that Ossoff could win outright were buoyed early Tuesday evening by promising early vote returns, but Ossoff’s vote share continued to drop as more precincts reported their votes. Reports of technical glitches stemming from Fulton County delayed the results for hours as Ossoff hovered right at that 50 percent threshold. With 100 percent of precincts reporting early Wednesday morning, Ossoff had 48.1 percent and Handel had 19.8 percent. While Ossoff ran far better than any other Democrat had in this district before, narrowly missing the runoff will be a disappointment for the party because it allows Republicans to reload and unite behind one candidate. But Democrats are still heartened by the gains they've made in the red district. Democrats rallied behind Ossoff, a 30-year-old investigative filmmaker, in the hopes that he could clear the field in one night and deliver a major upset in a district President Trump narrowly won a few months ago. The hope—to make the special election a referendum on Trump and serve as an early indicator ahead of the 2018 midterm elections when Democrats need to flip at least two dozen seats to take back the House majority. Despite not clearing the field on Tuesday, Democrats harnessed their base's energy and made a race for a seat that has trended red for decades competitive. Ossoff received an abundance of national support, including paid staffers from the House Democrats’ campaign arm, and hauled in an unprecedented $8.3 million in three months. Ossoff called out to those successes as he addressed supporters just before midnight, with the results still in flux. “No matter what the outcome is tonight, whether we take it all or we fight on, we have defied the odds, we have shattered expectations,” he said. “We are changing the world and your voices are going to ring out across this state and across this country. We will be ready to fight on and win in June if it is necessary.” New Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Luján, the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, shared a similar message in a statement as he lauded Ossoff's lead.\"Ossoff has already defied the odds in this long-held Republican seat, and it’s clear that he has the enthusiasm and support he needs to be a very strong contender against Karen Handel in the runoff,\" he said. “Not only are these results an indication of Ossoff’s impressive grassroots campaign and powerful economic message, it’s clear that voters strongly oppose Republican-controlled Washington and its priorities, and are ready to send more independent voices to Congress.” For decades, Georgia’s 6th Congressional District had been considered a safe Republican seat. But Democrats have been licking their chops at the prospect of flipping the suburban Atlanta district ever since Trump won the district by less than 2 percentage points in November. As the race grew more heated and polls numbers showed Ossoff not far from 50 percent, Republicans grew increasingly nervous about their chances and started to pour millions of dollars into ad campaigns that attacked Ossoff as the “handpicked candidate” of House Democratic leadership in Washington and questioned his national security credentials. The pressure only increased after Democrats posted a strong showing last week in a special election in another House that had been seen as reliably red, Kansas’s 4th District. Even Trump weighed in last-minute, recording a robocall to rebuke Ossoff and tweeting that the Georgia Democrat is a “super liberal” and claiming he supports illegal immigration and tax increases. Ossoff fired back in a statement that Trump was “misinformed.” Soon after CNN called the race a runoff around midnight, Trump tweeted at Ossoff’s expense. “Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG 'R' win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!” he said. Looking ahead to the runoff, Ossoff’s chances of winning the reliably conservative seat grow steeper as the field of 18 candidates shrinks to two. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel previewed the party’s line of attack for the runoff in a statement that echoed Trump’s involvement in the race and chiding Democrats for “wasting millions of dollars.” “Tonight, voters listened to President Trump’s call to reject the tax-and-spend, soft on crime policies of Jon Ossoff, and I’m confident they will do the same when they return to the polls to elect Karen Handel as the next congresswoman from Georgia’s 6th District,” she said. “These liberal Democrats failed to inspire voters with a candidate who couldn’t even vote for himself, received 97 percent of his donations from outside the district, and consistently lied about his own weak resume.\" Handel, a former Georgia secretary of State, was considered an early favorite for the GOP side of the race and led most polls. She had the highest name recognition, after two unsuccessful statewide bids and a high-profile resignation from Susan G. Komen for the Cure over the charity's Planned Parenthood funding. Handel also endured the most intraparty attacks. The conservative Club for Growth, which endorsed GOP opponent Bob Gray, called her a “career politician.\" She also faced attacks from another fellow republican Dan Moody. --This report was updated at 6:02 a.m. Tags Marco Rubio lang: en_US inShare (function() )();",

      "text" : "President Donald Trump after signing an executive order last month aimed at reorganizing government. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trump plans to sign an executive order in Wisconsin on Tuesday that the White House says will make it harder for tech companies to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor, and will strengthen rules barring foreign contractors from bidding on government projects, according to senior administration officials. The officials, in a background call with reporters, said Trump will direct the Departments of Labor, Justice, State and Homeland Security to crack down on fraud and abuse in guest-worker programs by issuing new immigration rules. The president will also direct the Department of Commerce to review federal procurement rules and trade agreements with a view to putting American firms at an advantage when it comes to winning contracts. [This one group gets 70 percent of high-skilled foreign worker visas] The officials pitched the twin directives as benefiting working- and middle-class Americans who have suffered for too long under unfair trade and immigration rules. “This is the policy that ensures no one gets left behind in America anymore — that we protect our industry from unfair competition, favor the products produced by our fellow citizens and make certain that when jobs open those jobs are given to American workers first,” the White House said in a statement. It was not immediately clear how much the administration could accomplish without cooperation from Congress. “Sweeping changes are going to require congressional action,” said Lynden Melmed, an immigration attorney who had served as U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services chief counsel within the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush. However, industry experts said Trump’s executive order was a good first step to protecting the U.S. defense industrial base, and U.S. firms that do business with the federal government. “It’s one of the few presidential exertions in recent time, that holds out the hope of saving U.S. industrial jobs,” said Loren Thompson, a defense industry consultant and the chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute in Arlington. Although Trump vacillated on the question of whether he supported the H-1B visa program as a candidate, he said repeatedly that he wanted American firms and American workers to carry out federal projects. The executive order prepares to make good on that promise after a series of reversals by the new president on essential questions of international economic policy. On Friday, Trump’s treasury secretary declined to officially accuse China of manipulating its currency, which Trump had pledged to do on his first day in office. A draft of a letter from the administration to Congress obtained by The Washington Post and other media organizations last month called for only minor changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the president once declared “the worst trade deal maybe ever.” Yet supporters of a more protectionist procurement policy were not yet prepared to declare victory. “We’re encouraged that this is an important first step. It essentially means the president is turning his words into action,” said Scott Boos, a senior vice president at the Alliance for American Manufacturing. He added, though, that “the true test” would come after the administration had completed its reviews and begun to propose new policies. [The places in America most vulnerable to a trade war] White House officials singled out the H-1B visa for “high-skilled” foreigners in the science and engineering industries as the priority for reform, but said a comprehensive review could lead to changes in other guest worker programs, including visas Trump’s own company uses for foreign workers at his hotels, golf courses and vineyard. Trump, who campaigned on an “America First” ideology, had promised to “end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program.” His executive order would require the agencies to perform administrative reviews immediately and propose reforms to ensure that the H-1B visas are awarded to the most skilled and highest paid workers, officials said. The officials said reform could first come through administrative changes, such as raising the visa application fees, adjusting the wage scale to more accurately reflect prevailing salaries in the tech industry, and more vigorously enforcing violations. It could also change the lottery system to give foreigners with U.S. master’s degrees a leg up. The current worker visa program has been diluted as rules have gone unenforced, the officials said. Indian outsourcing firms such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro currently receive the lion’s share of the visas because they submit tens of thousands of applications to increase their chances. The firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mike Emmons, a software developer in Longwood, Florida, who was let go from Siemens ICN after training his foreign replacement in 2002, applauded Trump’s executive order. “It was the most depressing thing I've ever been through — having to train people to do my job, only so I could get laid off,” said Emmons, 55, who now works for a Florida state agency. “After watching this for 14 years, what Trump is doing is a thousandfold better than what Bush did, or Obama or what Hillary would have done. He’s doing something for us.” Some advocates for H-1B visa reform cautioned against making rash changes without considering the ripple effect on the nation’s green card system or employers at large. “There are a handful of companies that have stirred controversy in this space but there are 27,000 other employers that still have to use this system,” said Scott Corley, executive director of Compete America, a coalition of mostly tech companies advocating for immigration reform to benefit high-skilled foreign workers. “If you basically go in and take a sledgehammer to the program without any thought for collateral damage, the cure can be worse than the ailment. Change needs to come. It comes down to how you do it.” Melmed, who also serves as counsel for Compete America, said the law does not give Trump much wiggle room to make meaningful change without Congress — though it could tip the scale in favor of foreign workers who hold advanced degrees from U.S. universities. “It is no secret who the president is going after,” Melmed said, referring to the giant outsourcing firms. “Companies that pay low wages are going to face a difficult few years.” Ron Hira, a research associate with the Economic Policy Institute and an H-1B visa expert who teaches public policy at Howard University, called Trump’s executive order a “step in the right direction” but it remains to be seen whether it “dislodges the stalemate that’s in Congress right now.” On Monday the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it received 199,000 petitions for 85,000 slots during this year’s H-1B visa lottery. Last year, the agency received 236,000 applications. The president will also order a review of existing federal procurement policies. These are statutes and rules instituted over the decades that may bar foreign contractors from bidding for jobs, exclude certain raw materials from abroad, or mandate that international firms deliver projects at reduced prices relative to American firms in order to win contracts. The administration will also review exceptions to these policies granted under free-trade agreements and the World Trade Organization. While these agreements are designed to give U.S. firms access to foreign governments’ contracts in exchange for allowing firms from abroad to bid on federal projects, a senior administration official argued that U.S. bids are treated unfairly overseas. The administration official cited a Government Accountability Office report from February finding that foreign governments opened fewer bids to American firms than the federal government opens to international firms. But the report also noted that data on procurement from around the world is unreliable and incomplete, and U.S. firms may have more success than foreign competitors in winning bids that are open to global competition. business wonkblog true Wonkbook newsletter Your daily policy cheat sheet from Wonkblog. Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Jeffry J. Schott of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington argues that opening federal procurement to international contractors had worked to the advantage of U.S. industry. This is because American firms have been able to take advantage of the opportunities they received from abroad in return — especially, for example, in supplying components to Japanese monopolies. The order will also limit the use of waivers to Trump’s “Buy American” policies and allow agencies to penalize contractors that rely on raw materials from abroad that are unfairly subsidized by foreign governments. Finally, Trump’s order will affirm the government’s commitment to standards for determining what counts as U.S. steel for purposes of procurement. The official argued that ensuring steel used in federal projects is both melted and poured, and not just finished, in the United States will protect American mills and steelworkers. “It’s just, boom — this is what America wants, and the president intends to give ‘Buy American, Hire American’ to the American people,” the official said. Other experts were more skeptical. “I think U.S. firms probably sell a lot more to the Mexican government — supply Mexican government contracts — much more than Mexican firms supply U.S. government contracts,” Schott said.",

      "text" : "What’s a blanket on a cold airplane worth?Not $12, at least not for one passenger on a recent Hawaiian Airlines flight from Las Vegas to Hawaii. A 66-year-old man was charged $12 for the blanket, but not with anything else, despite causing the flight to be diverted to Los Angeles. According to news reports, the passenger was deemed “unruly” by airport police after saying he “would like to take someone behind the woodshed for this,” and was removed from the flight.“Diverting a fight is clearly not our first choice, but our crew felt it was necessary to divert to Los Angeles and deplane the passenger before beginning to fly over the Pacific Ocean,” the airline said in a statement.George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, said: “I think Hawaiian should have just given him the blanket for free. Doing that emergency landing cost Hawaiian thousands of dollars. This fee seems more silly than exorbitant.”As most passengers can’t help but notice, add-on fees are becoming more and more prevalent. Mr. Hobica said the fee that makes most passengers angry is the one for changing flights, which costs an average of $200 on domestic flights. But that does not mean the smaller fees aren’t aggravating.A recent study by the farecasting app Hopper showed that airlines are increasingly “unbundling” their flights, offering lower base prices for travelers to get on the plane and making them pay à la carte for almost everything else, from seat assignments to baggage and in-flight supplements like food, entertainment and, apparently, blankets. These secondary fees now represent roughly 10 percent of total airline revenues, according to Hopper.The problem is that the fees vary greatly from airline to airline and class to class, which means comparing base ticket prices has become almost meaningless.“From the consumer’s perspective, this results in increased confusion, and makes it frustratingly difficult to comparison shop or to understand the full cost of travel,” said Patrick Surry, Hopper’s chief data scientist.For example, Spirit offers the lowest base ticket prices of the eight airlines studied by Hopper, with a median fare of $356, but charges the most for baggage ($50 for the first bag, $111 for the second) and for changing flights ($250). Throw in a $35 carry-on fee and, if you’re a traveler with two checked bags who has changed your flight, you could be paying more than twice the cost of your base fare.Hopper’s recently released Fair Bear feature aims to help by breaking down the restrictions or fees associated with your flight, Mr. Surry said.But there’s more you can do to keep your flight costs closer to what you thought you were paying in the first place. Here’s what you need to know about the most common and costly fees.The change fee is not only the most costly but also the most difficult to avoid. And don’t even think about canceling.The Hopper study (which excludes data from Southwest and Delta) found that a nonrefundable, domestic reservation in the main cabin is usually changeable, for a price. For example, United charges an average of $200 to change a domestic flight, while Virgin America’s fee is $125, which is the lowest of the airlines studied. The fee varies among the budget airlines as well, with Frontier charging $198 and Spirit $250.“The higher the change fee on a nonrefundable airfare, the greater the incentive for some travelers to simply buy a more expensive refundable airfare,” Mr. Hobica said.If you’re prone to changing plans, try to book with Southwest, which is the only major domestic airline that does not charge for canceling or changing your flight. Alaska Airlines will also let it slide if you do so within 60 days (otherwise it’s $125).Do not expect to see these fees get cheaper or go away anytime soon, unless airlines take away the option of changing a flight altogether.“I wouldn’t be surprised to see change fees go to $250, or for changes and cancellations to be eliminated entirely, as the airlines have done with their ‘basic economy’ airfares,” Mr. Hobica said.It’s hard for me to remember a time when I did not expect to pay extra for baggage. But if you go back about 10 years, there were none.Standard baggage fees for domestic flights have remained steady for several years now at $25 (Spirit and Frontier charge more), but airlines pick up the slack with their charges for overweight bags, which have crept up over the years, Mr. Hobica said.Once again, Southwest is the no-fee winner, not charging for checked bags (with some size and weight restrictions). You won’t see much budging on this from other airlines (except on international flights).“Another recent trend is more carriers are starting to charge for carry-on luggage,” Mr. Surry said. Spirit and Frontier already charge for a carry-on.“The Big Three domestic airlines are following a similar model with their basic fares, where carry-on luggage may not be permitted unless you’re willing to pay extra,” Mr. Hobica said, referring to United, Delta and American.United, for example, allows only one personal item in its recently created Basic Economy tier, meaning you will have to pay just for using the overhead bin.In general, learning to pack well is your best chance to reduce baggage fees; weighing your luggage before leaving home will help make sure there are not any surprises at check-in.And now we come full circle to the $12 blanket.“The most important step in reducing your total cost is to plan carefully for what additional services you’ll use when you travel, and pay attention to what those add-ons will cost if they’re not included in the base price,” Mr. Surry said.Most airline websites list these fees, which vary by airline, fare and flight, so do your homework.American and Delta made most of their in-flight entertainment options free last year, but many others, including Southwest and Hawaiian, still charge for movies and television.Bringing your own tablet with pre-downloaded content (don’t forget the earbuds, for which many airlines also charge) is now a no-brainer; you’ll avoid charges for what you watch. Many airlines allow access to free entertainment options via apps that you download in advance. You will also avoid any potential rental charges for tablets; domestic airlines charge between $8 and $15 depending on the length of flight.Other common-sense approaches for saving money include eating at the airport or bringing a sandwich onboard. And don’t forget to dress appropriately; nobody wants to pay $12 for a blanket.",

      "text" : "(Andrew Harnik/Associated Press) After almost 100 days in office, President Trump has finally found his forte: one-page tax plans. That's how long his first one was last September, and how long his new one was Wednesday. There's a reason for this. If you compare them side-by-side, you can see that Trump's two main innovations this time around are using bullet points and offering less specificity. Everything else is just about the same. Indeed, the “new details” of Trump's new plan aren't new and aren't details. They're more like an Oprah-themed wish list: you get a tax cut, and you get a tax cut, and you in the top 1 percent really get a tax cut. Trump, you see, wants to slash the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent, reduce individual tax rates across the board, double the size of the standard deduction, eliminate the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax and the Affordable Care Act investment taxes, and supposedly pay for it all by closing unspecified loopholes. This was his plan during the campaign, and, despite all the fanfare about his \"big announcement,\" it's still his plan today. About the only change is that he now says he'd get rid of the state and local tax deduction. Well, that and the fact that he doesn't know where he'd set his tax brackets anymore. Back in September, he said that under his proposal a married couple would pay 12 percent on their first $75,000, 25 percent on anything between $75,000 and $225,000, and 33 percent on anything above that. But even that minimum level of detail is absent from his latest version. All he says now is that he'd have three brackets of 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. (He tweaked the first and last ones a little). Good luck trying to figure out what you'd owe. The Trump administration unveiled their proposal to overhaul the tax code on April 26, outlining sharply lower tax rates but fewer tax breaks. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) But that's not the biggest difference between them. No, the biggest difference is that the first edition of Trump's plan was merely wildly implausible, while the slightly updated second one is actually impossible. It has to do with the rules for what's known as budget reconciliation. Those rules say that you can pass a bill with just 51 votes in the Senate instead of the 60 votes Republicans would need (but do not have) to beat a filibuster so long as it doesn't add to the deficit after 10 years. business wonkblog true Wonkbook newsletter Your daily policy cheat sheet from Wonkblog. Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters That matters, because the $6 trillion or $7 trillion that the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says Trump's plan would cost over the course of a decade is too much to realistically pay for just by closing loopholes. So he'd have to do what George W. Bush did with his own tax cuts: pass them with the provision that they'd expire in 10 years' time. Except that, according to the official scorekeepers at the Joint Committee on Taxation, wouldn't work either, because the costs of a corporate tax cut like the one Trump is proposing are so long-lasting that even a three-year-long cut would lose money after 10 years. In other words, Trump's tax plan doesn't have enough specifics to actually be called a plan, but the specifics it does have would keep it from ever being a plan. If you were appropriately cynical, you might say that Trump has just trolled everybody into acting like his campaign tax plan is some major new development, all so that he can claim he's getting things done in the first 100 days he's obsessed over so much. After all, printing something out that you had online and reformatting it with bullet points isn't normally construed as “progress.” Not even if you're a college kid trying to pass your outline off as a final draft. Maybe next time Trump should try using bigger fonts so that his plan goes onto two pages and looks twice as good.",

      "text" : "With a healthcare failure under their belt and an upcoming showdown over keeping the government open, the Trump administration is looking to score a legislative win and must garner bipartisan support to do so. As the debate in Washington turns to tax reform, improvements to the earned income tax credit (EITC) is one of the policy options that can help bring together both sides of the aisle. Many Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck and struggle to make financial ends meet due to low wages, earnings that can change week to week, and an uncertain economic future. The earned income tax credit, created in 1975, is a powerful tool for increasing take-home pay while encouraging work. To qualify for this tax credit, which grows as one’s income rises until it phases out gradually for moderate- to middle-income families, one must work and prove the receipt of earnings. The credit is also “refundable,” which means that it can exceed one’s federal income tax liability. Many conservatives support the EITC, because it’s clearly a hand-up, not a handout. Many progressives champion the EITC as well, not only because it increases employment but because it helps ameliorate low pay and state and local tax systems that have workers making the least paying the most in proportion to their incomes. The 28 million Americans benefitting from the credit receive $2,500 on average. The EITC lifts approximately 6.5 million people out of poverty — including 3.3 million children — while reducing poverty for 21 million more. At least as important are the long-term educational, health and earnings and employment benefits to adults who benefited from the EITC as kids. But the number of people benefiting from the EITC could and should be higher. Because it phases in from the first dollar of earnings each year, the EITC helps anyone who wants to work, work. This means it supports part-time or part-year work among people struggling with disability, illness, caregiving responsibilities, recent job loss or other challenges. Businesses are also generally pro-EITC, because it helps low-wage employees without raising the cost of labor and expands the supply of workers. Still, the EITC could do much more to help hard-working families. First, it could be provided biweekly or monthly throughout the tax year, instead of as one lump sum during tax filing season, to better help families avoid financial hardship and smooth out consumption. Second, we could make the credit even more efficient while helping more hard-working individuals and families. An estimated 21 percent of eligible families don’t participate in the EITC, either due to lack of awareness or the complexity of filing for the tax credit. In addition, IRS studies, though potentially overstating the improper payment rate, estimate it to be over 22 percent — and the actual rate is needlessly high, due in significant part to the credit’s complexity. Eligible workers whose employers use electronic payroll processing should be able to adjust their withholdings at their jobs, collecting the EITC and a greater paycheck each month. Electronic payroll processing would ensure a simpler and more accurate process both for workers and the government. This policy might even result in savings to the government by reducing payment errors and enforcement costs. Another crucial component is a safe-harbor provision. Imagine a taxpayer who, upon qualifying for the EITC in the first three months of the year, received a partial benefit — and then, in the last nine months of the year, earned a promotion at work and higher pay. Without a safe-harbor provision, the worker’s family would lose out on the EITC for the entire year. A safe harbor would ensure that families aren’t penalized for getting ahead at work, thus improving the effectiveness of the EITC as a pro-work and anti-poverty program. Similar provisions already exist for other tax benefits. Savings from these changes could be used to maximize the impact of the EITC by expanding its benefits for workers not raising children, including younger workers aged 18 and up, noncustodial parents, and those with older children. This would achieve the long-sought goal of ensuring that the federal government does not tax people into poverty. While the earned income tax credit is good public policy, it can be strengthened. By working together across the aisle and taking these simple steps, we'll lift more Americans into the middle class, reduce administrative burdens for the government, incentivize work and put more money back into the pockets of low- and moderate-income Americans who most need it. With tax reform front and center, it’s time to make the EITC even more great!

      "text" : "WICHITA, Kan. — A Democratic civil rights attorney running in the nation’s first congressional election since President Donald Trump’s November victory has made the race surprisingly competitive for a Kansas House seat held by a Republican for more than two decades. The special election Tuesday between Democrat James Thompson and Republican Ron Estes to fill the seat vacated by CIA Director Mike Pompeo is being watched across the nation for signs of a backlash against Republicans or waning support from Trump’s supporters. Trump won 60 percent of the votes cast in the 17-county congressional district that includes the state’s largest city of Wichita. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have both recorded get-out-the-vote calls on behalf of Estes, the state’s treasurer. But in a sign of nervousness in the waning days of the campaign, Republicans poured money into the race to bolster Estes, who was criticized by Thompson for avoiding some events to which both leading candidates were invited. “Republican Ron Estes needs your vote and needs it badly,” Trump said in his minute-long call. “Our country needs help. Ron is going to be helping us, big league.” The contest also pulled Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas to campaign in Kansas for Estes. Cruz told about 200 people who came to a GOP rally Monday that the Democratic hard-core base is going to show up for the special election. “Our enemy right now is complacency,” Cruz said. Thompson spent the final day of campaigning talking directly to voters. His campaign announced Monday that it hit 20,000 in total donors, with most people giving small-dollar contributions. Republicans have represented the south-central Kansas district since 1994. Trump’s picks for top jobs in his administration and a California Democratic appointment have created five openings in the U.S. House, where Republicans have a 237-193 edge. Republicans are defending four GOP-leaning seats — the Kansas seat plus Georgia, Montana and South Carolina — while Democrats are protecting a seat in a liberal California district.

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — The husband-and-wife team of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, now both senior federal government officials, has been alongside President Trump as the White House has hosted dozens of chief executives and a handful of world leaders in recent weeks.It is a rarefied crowd, one that has included the top executives of some of the world’s largest automobile, airline, chemical, pharmaceutical and tech companies. Mr. Kushner will continue to keep such select company now that he has helped create a new office that Mr. Trump is calling the White House Office of American Innovation.But the financial disclosure report released late Friday for Mr. Kushner, which shows that he and his wife still benefit financially from a real estate and investment empire worth as much as $740 million, makes clear that this most powerful Washington couple is walking on perilous legal and ethical ground, according to several prominent experts on the subject.Unlike Mr. Trump, who is exempt from conflict of interest laws, both Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump — who took a formal White House position this past week — are forbidden under federal criminal and civil law to take any action that might benefit their particular financial holdings.“Donald Trump can evade legal responsibility even if the conflicts of interest remain,” said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group. “His daughter and son-in-law don’t have that escape hatch.”Mr. Kushner did resign from more than 200 positions in the partnerships and limited liability companies that make up the family-run multibillion-dollar real estate business. But the financial disclosure report shows that Mr. Kushner will remain a beneficiary of most of those same entities.Jamie Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general at the Justice Department during the Clinton administration and is now advising Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump on government ethics issues, said that the couple could continue to hold on to so many of their assets because most of the value is tied up in buildings.“The real estate assets that Kushner is holding on to are unlikely to pose the kinds of conflicts that would trigger the need to divest,” Ms. Gorelick, a partner at WilmerHale, the law firm, said in a statement on Friday. “The remaining conflicts, from a practical perspective, are pretty narrow and very manageable.”But real estate projects like the Kushner Companies’ deals have become a magnet for opaque foreign money — often from parts of the world that present thorny policy questions, such as China, where Mr. Kushner’s company has actively sought investors, as well as the Middle East and Russia. As part of his exceptionally broad portfolio in the White House, Mr. Kushner has been a crucial figure in arranging the visit of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, on Thursday in Florida.The mystery behind many real estate investments involving foreigners prompted the Treasury Department last year to push for additional disclosures as a way to combat money laundering.While Mr. Kushner may face a potential ethical minefield, the disclosure form makes it difficult to determine exactly where those mines might be situated. The form, which runs 54 pages and lists hundreds of entities, reveals few details about the underlying investments that make up the Kushner empire, such as the addresses of buildings, sources of financing and names of partners.John Pudner, a conservative who has helped elect Tea Party candidates to Congress and now runs a nonprofit group called Take Back Our Republic, said that Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump, if they wanted to serve in the White House, would have been better off if they had taken the difficult step of liquidating their holdings.“A win-win for the president’s family and everyone else is if there were no question anytime a decision is made that it’s being done for the good of the country,” he said.The actions by Mr. Kushner stand in contrast to the moves by some other top aides to Mr. Trump, such as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who before he was sworn in agreed to liquidate all of his stock holdings and his ownership stake in Exxon, putting his assets mostly into Treasury bonds and other permitted investments, such as diversified mutual funds, which make formal financial conflicts unlikely.Mr. Kushner, by contrast, continues to hold multimillion-dollar lines of credit from institutions such as Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, while companies he is still a beneficiary of have billions of dollars in additional loans from heavily regulated institutions.Richard W. Painter, who served as a White House ethics lawyer in the Bush administration, said that Mr. Kushner’s financial holdings would complicate any interactions he might have with such banks. “The one thing Jared really ought to stay completely away from is anything having to do with Dodd-Frank,” Mr. Painter said, referring to the 2010 law that increased capital reserve requirements and instituted many other regulatory changes that affected the nation’s banks.Mr. Trump has already said he hopes to roll back the law, with the help of Congress and his top aides.Several of the companies that are in business with Kushner Companies have faced scrutiny by federal law enforcement. Deutsche Bank, for example, reached a $7.2 billion settlement last year with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities.Mr. Kushner, who frequently speaks with world leaders and is tasked with overseeing Middle East peace negotiations, also has an unsecured line of credit worth as much as $5 million from Israel Discount Bank. Kushner Companies has also taken out at least four loans from Bank Hapoalim, Israel’s largest bank, though they are not disclosed in the filing. That firm is the subject of a Justice Department investigation into whether it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes with undeclared accounts.Another potential conflict rests in Ms. Trump’s continued stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, a project that has drawn protests from ethics experts who worry that people representing special interests could stay there or host events there to gain influence with the White House, which is just a few blocks away.Ms. Trump has rolled her fashion brand into the Ivanka M. Trump Business Trust, which is overseen by her brother-in-law, Josh Kushner, and sister-in-law, Nicole Meyer. The documents released on Friday valued the trust at more than $50 million.Discussions about changes in federal tax law — a major agenda item for Mr. Trump that could affect issues such as depreciation on Mr. Kushner’s buildings and clothing imported for Ms. Trump’s brand — could also pose problems, or force them to recuse themselves from participating.“They are going to have to walk a fine line between matters they are involved with financially and the policies they are helping create and legislation they may be advocating,” said Scott H. Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group.The federal ethics regulations formally prohibit federal employees from being involved in any “particular matter that will have a direct effect on a financial interest, if there is a close causal link between any decision or action to be taken in the matter and any expected effect of the matter on the financial interest.”But Mr. Painter said that most administrations had interpreted the law more broadly, so that officials who own stakes in individual industries do not participate in even broad policy decisions affecting that sector, unless they seek a formal ethics waiver, as certain officials did during the first George Bush administration, given that they owned energy industry stocks and were participating in the decision to enter the war against Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait.Federal employees, under ethics rules that Mr. Trump imposed, are also prohibited, for at least two years after they arrive in the government, from working on particular matters that involve former employers or clients, even if these actions do not directly financially benefit the federal employee.The disclosures by Mr. Kushner and other White House officials released on Friday demonstrate just how complicated it is going to be to police these rules, given the vast and extremely complex financial assets not only within the Trump family but also among dozens of aides they have selected.The National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, as well as the top White House aides Christopher P. Liddell and Reed Cordish, collectively reported assets with a maximum value of more than $1 billion. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, reported assets worth as much as $53.9 million. Even Mr. Bannon’s aide Julia Hahn, who is 25, reported investments worth between $1 million and $2.1 million, according to a tally by The New York Times, while Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, had assets worth between $11 million and $44 million.Some of those financial holdings are already creating questions.Mr. Liddell, an assistant to the president and the director of strategic initiatives, has participated in White House meetings since January that involved several companies in which he continued at least through February to own stock in, including International Paper and General Motors.Mr. Bannon disclosed more than $500,000 in income from entities linked to the hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, major Republican donors who were crucial figures in Mr. Bannon’s appointment as the Trump campaign’s chief executive last year.Mr. Bannon is selling off some of these assets, his financial disclosure report says, including shares in Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm, and Breitbart News, the right-wing website. But Mr. Bannon, even after joining the White House, has continued to interact with certain reporters at Breitbart, at times to express frustration with the site’s coverage of the White House or to discuss coverage, editors there have said.Even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, wrote a letter on Friday to the Office of Government Ethics saying he should not have made a supportive remark about a film, “The Lego Batman Movie,” that one of his companies helped produce. The comment was viewed by some as a commercial endorsement of the film.“The White House staff’s massive businesses are creating so many possible conflicts of interest it seems almost impossible for them to avoid running into trouble as they mix their former business interests with their new professional duties,” Mr. Bookbinder said.",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — As he confronted a series of international challenges from the Middle East to Asia last week, President Trump made certain that nothing was certain about his foreign policy. To the extent that a Trump Doctrine is emerging, it seems to be this: don’t get roped in by doctrine.In a week in which he hosted foreign heads of state and launched a cruise missile strike against Syria’s government, Mr. Trump dispensed with his own dogma and forced other world leaders to re-examine their assumptions about how the United States will lead in this new era. He demonstrated a highly improvisational and situational approach that could inject a risky unpredictability into relations with potential antagonists, but he also opened the door to a more traditional American engagement with the world that eases allies’ fears.As a private citizen and candidate, Mr. Trump spent years arguing that Syria’s civil war was not America’s problem, that Russia should be a friend, and that China was an “enemy” whose leaders should not be invited to dinner. As president, Mr. Trump, in the space of just days, involved America more directly in the Syrian morass than ever before, opened a new acrimonious rift with Russia, and invited China’s leader for a largely convivial, let’s-get-along dinner at his Florida estate.In the process, Mr. Trump upended domestic politics as well. He rejected the nationalist wing of his own White House, led by Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, who opposes entanglement in Middle East conflicts beyond fighting terrorism and favors punitive trade measures against Beijing. And Mr. Trump, by launching the strike on Russia’s ally Syria, undercut critics who have portrayed him as a Manchurian candidate doing the bidding of President Vladimir V. Putin after the Kremlin intervened in last year’s election on his behalf.Given his unpredictability, none of this means that Mr. Trump has pivoted permanently in any of these areas. The White House has prepared an executive order that the president may sign in the coming days targeting countries like China that dump steel in the American market. And Mr. Trump is sending Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Tuesday to Moscow, where he will have the additional task of trying to smooth over the rancor of recent days, in addition to exploring whether Russia could be a real partner in battling the Islamic State in Syria.Moreover, the missile strike, in response to a chemical weapons attack, was intended to be a limited, one-time operation, and the president seemed determined to quickly move on. After announcing the attack Thursday evening, he made no mention of it Friday during public appearances, nor on Saturday during his weekly address. As of Saturday morning, the Twitter-obssessed president had not even taunted President Bashar al-Assad of Syria online, although he did thank the American troops who carried out the missile strike.“Our decisions,” Mr. Trump said in the Saturday address, “will be guided by our values and our goals — and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences.”That concept, flexibility, seems key to understanding Mr. Trump. He hates to be boxed in, as he mused in the Rose Garden last week while contemplating the first new military operation of his presidency with geopolitical consequences.“I like to think of myself as a very flexible person,” he told reporters. “I don’t have to have one specific way.” He made clear he cherished unpredictability. “I don’t like to say where I’m going and what I’m doing,” he said.That flexibility was a hallmark of his rise in real estate, and if critics preferred the word erratic, it did not bother Mr. Trump — it has since worked well enough to vault him to the White House. But now that he is commander in chief of the world’s most powerful nation, leaders around the world are trying to detect a method to the man.“There is no emerging doctrine for Trump foreign policy in a classical sense,” said Kathleen H. Hicks, a former Pentagon official who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There are, however, clear emerging characteristics consistent with the attributes of the man himself: unpredictable, instinctual and undisciplined.”On Syria, Mr. Trump had mocked President Barack Obama for setting a “red line” against the use of chemical weapons and urged him not to launch a punitive strike against Syria after Mr. Assad crossed it in 2013. That attack, with a death toll of 1,400, dwarfed last week’s toll of 84. And just days before last week’s attack, Mr. Tillerson indicated that Washington would accept Mr. Assad’s remaining in power.Indeed, critics, including Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, argued that Mr. Assad felt free to launch a chemical attack precisely because Mr. Trump’s administration had given him a green light.Russia, critics added, did not constrain Mr. Assad because it has had a blank check from an overly friendly Trump administration. And Mr. Trump’s efforts to bar Syrian refugees from the United States, they said, sent a signal that he did not care about them.“President Trump seems not to have thought through any of this, or have any kind of broader strategy, but rather to have launched a military strike based on a sudden, emotional decision,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote in an article for The Huffington Post on Saturday.Mr. Assad is not the only leader testing Mr. Trump. North Korea has test-launched missile after missile in recent weeks, almost as if trying to get Mr. Trump’s attention.So far, he has been measured in his response, urging President Xi Jinping of China during his visit at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida to do more to rein in North Korea. But national security aides have also prepared options for Mr. Trump if China does not take a more assertive stance, including reintroducing nuclear weapons in South Korea.Mr. Trump’s action in Syria was welcomed by many traditional American allies who had fretted over Mr. Obama’s reluctance to take a greater leadership role in the Middle East, and feared that Mr. Trump would withdraw even more.After the missile strike, Israeli news outlets were filled with headlines like “The Americans Are Back,” and European leaders expressed relief both that he had taken action and that he had not gone too far.“We have learned that Trump is not so isolationist as many Europeans feared he would be — he appears to care about victims of a gas attack in Syria,” said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform in London. “We have learned that he understands that U.S. influence had suffered from the perception — which grew under Obama — that it was a power weakened by its reluctance to use force.”That touches on another animating factor as Mr. Trump deals with foreign challenges — doing the opposite of whatever Mr. Obama did. Mr. Trump’s first instinct after the Syrian chemical attack was to blame Mr. Obama for not enforcing his red line, never mind that Mr. Trump had urged him not to at the time. Even as he announced the missile strike on Thursday night, Mr. Trump asserted that his predecessor’s handling of Syria had “failed very dramatically.”Intentionally or not, though, Mr. Trump adopted language similar to that used by Mr. Obama and many other presidents in defining American priorities. While in the past Mr. Trump said the United States did not have a national interest in Syria, last week he said instability there was “threatening the United States and its allies.”He also said that “America stands for justice,” effectively espousing a responsibility to act in cases of human rights abuses, as other presidents have at times.Until now, Mr. Trump has largely eschewed such language. Just three days earlier, he had hosted Egypt’s authoritarian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and made no public mention of the thousands of people the Cairo government has imprisoned in a political crackdown.“What is striking to me is a subtle yet clear shift away from the rhetoric of pure American self-interest narrowly defined, as espoused by candidate Donald Trump,” said Robert Danin, a former Middle East negotiator who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. “What has emerged is a new language of American leadership in the world that we have not heard before from President Trump.”Mr. Grant and others noted that the strike, coming as Mr. Trump shared a meal with Mr. Xi, could resonate in Asia as well, leaving North Korea to wonder whether the president might resort to force to stop its development of ballistic missiles.But Ms. Hicks said Mr. Trump’s flexibility — or unpredictability — was itself “extremely risky.” If other countries cannot accurately predict what an American president will do, she said, they may act precipitously, citing the example of China’s extending its maritime claims in the South China Sea.“Imagine if Donald Trump then took exception in ways they didn’t anticipate and major wars ensued,” she said. “Bright lines, derived from clear interests and enforced well, are generally best, and I don’t think Donald Trump likes to be constrained by bright lines.”",

      "text" : "Cleveland police announced a $50,000 reward has been posted by Crimestoppers Monday for information leading to the capture of the man suspected of killing a random passerby and posting the gruesome footage on Facebook Sunday. Police have issued a nationwide search for Steve Stephens, 37, and asked residents of Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, and Michigan to be on alert. UPDATE Homicide suspect Steve Stephens' actual vehicle has Ohio Temp tag E363630 pic.twitter.com/tE3r5u4BNN— Cleveland Police (@CLEpolice) April 17, 2017 Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said officers searched dozens of locations for Stephens with no success. The department is working with federal, state and other local agencies to find him. “As far as we know right now, we don’t know where he’s at,\" Williams said at a Monday morning news conference. \"The last location we had him at was the homicide.” Williams also urged Stephens to turn himself in or contact a friend, relative, or clergy. “We definitely want to get it resolved as quickly as possible. The victim’s family deserves it,” said Williams. “At this point he could be a lot of places,\" said Steve Anthony, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Cleveland division. \"He could be nearby, he could be far away or anywhere in-between.” Police in Philadelphia said they have \"no indication\" Stephens is in the city despite 911 calls reporting he could be in or near Fairmount Park. Officers were sent to check the area, and police say eight elementary schools and a high school were locked down as a precaution. Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Stephens early Monday. He is charged with aggravated murder in the death of Robert Godwin. Williams said detectives had spoken with Stephens via cellphone at one point, but hadn't made any other contact with him. \"Early in this investigation we did have contact with him, direct contact with our detectives,\" Williams said. \"They tried to convince him to turn himself in.\" Stephens had no previous criminal record, only \"a lot\" of traffic violations, Williams said. The video of Godwin's murder posted to Facebook purportedly shows Stephens getting out of his car and targeting Godwin, 74, who is holding a plastic shopping bag. Stephens shouted the name of a woman, whom Godwin did not recognize. \"She's the reason that this is about to happen to you,\" Stephens told Godwin before pointing a gun at him. Godwin can be seen shielding his face with the shopping bag. The video of the killing was on the social media site for three hours before it was removed. Stephens' account also was removed. Facebook said the suspect did go live on the social media website at one point during the day, but not during the killing. Police earlier had said that Stephens had broadcast it on Facebook Live. \"This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook,\" said a company spokesperson. \"We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.\" Police said they have been talking with family and friends of Stephens, who is a case manager at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency headquartered in Pepper Pike, near Cleveland. \"We were shocked and horrified to learn of this news today,\" agency spokeswoman Nancy Kortemeyer said in a statement. \"We are hoping that the Cleveland Police will be able to apprehend Mr. Stephens as soon as possible and before anyone else is injured.\" In one of the videos he posted to Facebook, Stephens can be seen holding up his Beech Brook employee identification badge. Stephens also mentioned his fraternity, Omega Psi Phi, in one of his Facebook posts. The fraternity issued a statement Sunday night. \"On behalf of the Supreme Council and the members of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Incorporated, we lift our sincere and heartfelt prayers and condolences of comfort to the families impacted by the recent shooting in Cleveland, Ohio,\" it said. Police said Stephens should be considered armed and dangerous. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/syria-strike-sends-russia-a-signal-1491608375WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s quick-fire decision to strike a Syrian regime air base sent a shot across Russia’s bow, signaling that his administration is more willing to use force than its predecessor, even if it means riling the Kremlin and its allies.For months, officials in the Trump administration have been saying the U.S. must approach Russia from a position of strength, before improving relations with Moscow. When deciding how to respond to this week’s chemical-weapons attack, which the U.S. military blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, the 11-week-old administration also considered what message Mr. Trump wanted to send to the rest of the world in one of his earliest foreign-policy tests.“This is bigger than Syria,” a senior administration official said. “It’s representative of how he wants to be seen by other world leaders. It is important that people understand this is a different administration. ”Mr. Trump said he undertook the military strike to prevent and deter Mr. Assad from using chemical weapons. While it appeared to be a one-time action, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley warned more could be forthcoming.The unilateral strike represented a relatively modest intervention, U.S. officials said, small enough to avoid an intractable rift with Russia ahead of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s first official trip to Moscow next week. It crippled 20 of Mr. Assad’s jet fighters, according to the Pentagon, but didn’t target the air base’s runway. Local media reported Syrian planes were using the runway later Friday, though U.S. officials didn’t confirm that. The strikes didn’t come with any clear new policy doctrine on Syria, which experts say would be required to alter the course of the broader war Mr. Assad is winning thanks to Russia’s support. Still, the symbolic impact of the first direct U.S. strike on Mr. Assad since the beginning of the Syrian conflict has altered the dynamic between U.S. and Russia over Syria. For years Russian President Vladimir Putin was able to take advantage of a strictly limited appetite for risk in Washington—something the strike shows has now changed.One immediate result was Moscow’s declaration on Friday that it had suspended an agreement to coordinate military flights over Syria with Washington. U.S. officials said lines of communication remained open, but a weakening of such exchanges could heighten the risk of an incident over Syria, where U.S. jet fighters fly regularly in the campaign against Islamic State. The U.S. strikes could also lead to unpredictable reactions by Mr. Assad and his backers, in particular Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah.Despite such dangers, allies of Mr. Trump said they hoped the show of resolve marked the beginning of a change in Washington’s broader negotiating stance with Moscow.“Hopefully, this is something that very much changes the type of conversation that will take place between Putin and Tillerson when they meet,” said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R., Tenn.). Mr. Corker said the operation showed “the kind of pushback” Mr. Putin understands.It could also complicate Mr. Tillerson’s visit, at a moment when hopes for a quick U.S.-Russian rapprochement already had faded. “There’s a question of how well that visit will go,” said a senior administration official, who questioned whether Mr. Putin’s calculus has changed. “I doubt it, but we’ll see. The early Russian response isn’t encouraging.”In addition to the Syria conflict, Mr. Tillerson heads to Russia to raise other U.S. concerns, including Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, what the U.S. has called a violation of a Cold War-era pact that bans intermediate-range missiles, and Moscow’s alleged interference in the 2016 campaign.Despite the new strains, Moscow still planned to host Mr. Tillerson on his official visit next week. And even as Trump administration officials hit out at Mr. Assad, Russia’s longtime ally, the White House said the U.S. still wants to cooperate with Russia.“I think that there can be a shared commitment to defeat ISIS and also agree that you can’t gas your own people,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. “There is a mutual level of human decency that I think we can expect out of everybody.” VIEW Graphic Mr. Corker said one question Mr. Tillerson may try to answer in the visit is why the Assad regime had access to these chemical weapons despite a 2013 deal between the U.S. and Russia to remove Mr. Assad’s stockpile.The strikes have raised questions about Mr. Trump’s Syria policy and what next steps his administration plans to take. In the course of a few days, the administration went from Mr. Tillerson saying the Syrian people should decide the fate of Mr. Assad—a line the Kremlin has promoted—to Mr. Trump suggesting obliquely Mr. Assad should go. Mr. Tillerson said Thursday that Mr. Assad’s actions make clear there’s “no role for him to govern the Syrian people.”​Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that additional sanctions on Syria likely were forthcoming, signaling a hardening line that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has also been promoting. For years, Obama administration officials at the State Department and the Pentagon expressed frustration with White House unwillingness to use greater force in Syria, leaving former Secretary of State John Kerry with little leverage in his negotiations with Russia. Many of them approved of Thursday’s decision to strike Mr. Assad. Russia’s avowed cancellation Friday of the military channel between Moscow and Washington is one way the Russians can make any future U.S. unilateral strikes more difficult, said Michael Kofman, a Russian defense expert and research analyst at the Virginia-based Center for Naval Analyses“They want to make sure that we don’t have a channel where we can call them and announce we are bombing somewhere in Syria,” he said. Future U.S. actions against Mr. Assad also risk prompting blowback that could jeopardize U.S. troops in the region or raise the cost of involvement for the Trump administration to a degree that makes Washington balk.Mr. Putin has been able to undertake risky military gambits in places such as Syria and Ukraine in part because he has a lock on domestic politics in Russia, with little criticism or opposition, a luxury the White House doesn’t enjoy.“I think they calculate that if this is a game of chicken, that we’ll probably be the first ones to swerve to the side of the road,” said Michael Carpenter, the former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia under Mr. Obama. “They calculate that. It remains to be seen if that’s the case.”—Alan Cullison contributed to this article. Write to Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.com, Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com and Carol E.

      "text" : "Facebook is facing backlash after a Cleveland man uploaded a video of himself shooting someone to the social network, and followed it with a Live video confessing to the murder. The slaying and its subsequent distribution across Facebook has raised questions about how the company moderates violent content.Justin Osofsky, Facebook’s vice president of global operations, released a statement and timeline of the events and videos surrounding the incident.\nOsofsky’s statements hand off the responsibility for policing content on Facebook to its users, although he acknowledged the company can do better at moderation. He says artificial intelligence and new policies governing how videos are shared could present solutions to the issue, and that Facebook will try to speed up its current review process.\n“As a result of this terrible series of events, we are reviewing our reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible. In this case, we did not receive a report about the first video, and we only received a report about the second video — containing the shooting — more than an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted. We received reports about the third video, containing the man’s live confession, only after it had ended,” Osofsky wrote.\n11:09AM PDT — First video, of intent to murder, uploaded. Not reported to Facebook.\n11:11AM PDT — Second video, of shooting, uploaded.\n11:22AM PDT — Suspect confesses to murder while using Live, is live for 5 minutes.\n11:27AM PDT — Live ends, and Live video is first reported shortly after.\n12:59PM PDT — Video of shooting is first reported.\n1:22PM PDT — Suspect’s account disabled; all videos no longer visible to public.\nThe timeline demonstrates the failures of Facebook’s moderation system, which relies on user reports to flag controversial or violent content. While the Live video of the man’s confession was quickly reported by another user, the video of the killing itself went unreported and therefore remained online for nearly two hours.\n“Artificial intelligence, for example, plays an important part in this work, helping us prevent the videos from being reshared in their entirety. (People are still able to share portions of the videos in order to condemn them or for public awareness, as many news outlets are doing in reporting the story online and on television),” Osofsky said.\nEven with advances in artificial intelligence, it’s not clear that Facebook can prevent Live from being used to broadcast violence. The livestreaming service has already been used to share videos of shootings, torture, and sexual assault. And while users are angry at Facebook for allowing the Cleveland killing to be livestreamed, users were also outraged when a “technical glitch” caused the removal of video documenting the police murder of Philando Castile. Osofsky says that the Cleveland videos “goes against our policies and everything we stand for,” but there are times when users will expect Facebook to preserve violent videos because they have political importance. It’s a delicate balance, and one that isn’t likely to be solved by AI alone.\n“Facebook isn’t going to stop a murder. And I don’t care how good the AI gets, it’s unlikely any time soon to say ‘hey, that video is some person killing another person, don’t stream that.'” Mike Masnick noted on Techdirt. “Yes, senseless murders and violence lead people to go searching for answers, but sometimes there are no answers. And demanding answers from a random tool that was peripherally used connected to the senseless violence doesn’t seem helpful at all.” Featured Image: Getty Images/Miha9000/iStock (modified by TechCrunch)",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that this week’s devastating chemical weapons attack in Syria had changed his view of the brutal civil war in that country, though he declined to say how the United States would respond.Mr. Trump said the images of death inside Syria in the aftermath of the chemical attacks “crosses many lines, beyond a red line, many many lines.” And he said that the death of “innocent children, innocent babies, little babies” has made him reassess the situation and Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad.“It’s very, very possible, and I will tell you it has already happened, that my attitude toward Syria and Assad, has changed very much,” Mr. Trump said as he stood next to King Abdullah of Jordan in the Rose Garden for a news conference with reporters.Before the chemical attack, Mr. Trump’s administration had repeatedly said it did not intend to pursue the ouster of Mr. Assad. As recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump’s spokesman said doing so would be “silly” in the face of the political realities in the country.But Mr. Trump on Wednesday appeared to hint at a shift in that policy, though he offered only vague assertions that the aftermath of the chemical attack is “unacceptable” to him. Pressed on what his policy will be, Mr. Trump said it would be unwise to reveal any plans his administration might have.A shift could suggest that Mr. Trump is considering military action through aircraft or missile strikes, much the way that former President Barack Obama debated — and ultimately rejected — options in the wake of a similar chemical attack by the Syrian government in 2013.“I’m not saying I’m doing anything one way or the other,” Mr. Trump said, telling the reporter who asked the question: “But I’m certainly not going to be telling you, as much as I respect you.”Mr. Trump on Wednesday repeated his belief that Mr. Obama bears blame for the chemical attacks because he declared that the use of chemical weapons by Syria would “cross a red line” and then declined to follow up on that threat by using military force.“I think the Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis,” Mr. Trump said. “When he didn’t cross that line, after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways. It was a blank threat.”At the United Nations on Wednesday, the American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, used her remarks at an emergency session to blame Russia for blocking a robust response to the chemical weapons attack.The United States, France and Britain have accused the Syrian government of being responsible for the attack and have bitterly criticized Russia — Syria’s main ally in the six-year-old war — for objecting to a resolution condemning the attack.Russia has said insurgents may have been responsible or the attack may have been fabricated to embarrass Mr. Assad.“Time and time again Russia uses the same false narrative to deflect attention from their allies in Damascus,” Ms. Haley said. “How many more children have to die before Russia cares?”She closed her remarks with an ominous warning. “When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action,” she said. “For the sake of the victims, I hope the rest of the council is finally willing to do the same.”Mr. Trump pledged to work with Jordan and other allies in the Middle East to defeat the Islamic State.“We are both leaders on that,” Mr. Trump said, adding that “it will be a shorter fight than a lot of people are thinking about, believe me.”Mr. Trump called the king a “tireless advocate” for peace in the Middle East and said he hoped that the two countries could work with Israelis and Palestinians to achieve peace between them.Mr. Trump’s appearance beside King Abdullah came amid a flurry of deepening international crises in Syria and North Korea, and just hours after news broke of the president’s decision to remove Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, from a key committee at the National Security Council.Mr. Trump took questions from reporters after new reports that North Korea had fired a ballistic missile on Tuesday night, increasing concerns about Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, on the eve of a summit between Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, the president of China.Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson issued a short statement after the test, saying bluntly: “The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.”The decision to remove Mr. Bannon from the principals committee at the National Security Council reverses one of the president’s most contentious early national security actions. His original National Security Council included Mr. Bannon on the key committee, but demoted the role of several intelligence officials.In the meetings with King Abdullah, Mr. Trump planned to talk about his hopes for negotiating a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians with the help of Arab neighbors. While such an accord has eluded other presidents, Mr. Trump has expressed confidence that he and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, can bring the warring parties together.Jordan could be important to any negotiation. Home to many Palestinian refugees, it is one of just two Arab states with a peace treaty with Israel and acts as custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. King Abdullah has long been viewed as one of the most moderate of Arab leaders and close to a string of American presidents. He recently hosted Jason Greenblatt, Mr. Trump’s envoy, in Jordan.King Abdullah’s visit made him the first foreign leader to talk with Mr. Trump twice in person since the president took office. Fearing a violent backlash if Mr. Trump followed through with promises to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the king flew uninvited to Washington in January to buttonhole the president at a prayer breakfast and implore him to hold off. Mr. Trump obliged and has indicated he is rethinking such a move.But Mr. Trump has abandoned American insistence on the creation of a Palestinian state as the basis for any peace deal, a key condition for Jordan and other Arab states. Mr. Trump has said he could accept such a two-state solution but would also be fine with a one-state solution, if that was agreed to by the two sides.For King Abdullah, the visit was also important as the civil war in Syria escalates. Jordan has absorbed more than 600,000 Syrian refugees and become especially dependent on American and western assistance to cope with the influx.",

      "text" : "The Trump administration is weighing military retaliation against the Syrian government following a chemical attack Tuesday that killed scores of civilians, but it is complicated by the presence of Russian forces in the country and concerns about U.S. troops deployed in Syria in the campaign against the Islamic State, according to U.S. officials. The Pentagon is in the process of presenting options to the White House on potential military responses, which could include strikes on Syrian military targets and actions designed to ground the Syrian air force. Senior White House officials met on the topic Wednesday evening in a session that lasted into early Thursday, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, have communicated repeatedly about the issue since Tuesday’s attack, the officials said. [Deadly nerve agent sarin used in Syria attack, Turkish Health Ministry says] The Joint Chiefs of Staff were expected to meet early Thursday evening to discuss potential strike options, one military official said. One of the most likely is Tomahawk missiles launched from Navy ships in the Mediterranean Sea. Tillerson: 'Assad's role in the future is uncertain' Embed Copy Share Play Video1:40 (Reuters) Speaking from Palm Beach, Fla., Secretary of State Rex Tillerson placed the blame for a chemical attack that killed dozens of Syrian civilians squarely on the regime of the country's president, Bashar al-Assad. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson blames a chemical attack that killed dozens of Syrian civilians squarely on the regime of the country's president (Reuters) Some officials urged immediate action, warning against what one described as “paralysis through analysis.” But others were concerned about second- and third-order effects, including the response of Russia, which also has installed sophisticated air-defense systems in Syria, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Mattis called the attack a “heinous act” that would be “treated as such,” and President Trump suggested that he was deeply affected by the sight of the children and “beautiful babies” who were killed. “That crosses many, many lines,” Trump said. “Beyond a red line — many, many lines.” Tillerson on Thursday did not rule out military options to respond to an attack that he said violates international agreements and norms. He also suggested that the United States and other nations would consider somehow removing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power, but he did not say how. “We are considering an appropriate response for this chemical weapons attack,” Tillerson said in Palm Beach, Fla., where Trump will meet Thursday and Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “It is a serious matter. It requires a serious response,” Tillerson said. Asked about the future of the Syrian strongman, who has withstood a multifaceted war now in its seventh year, Tillerson appeared to change tack from earlier Trump administration statements about Assad. 1 of 14 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × EmbedCopyShare The scene in Syria after a chemical attack killed dozens View Photos At least 72 are reported dead after a chemical attack on a town in northern Syria.

He suggested, however, that he was speaking about a long process and not some sudden military move. “The process by which Assad would leave is something that I think requires an international community effort,” Tillerson said, “to both first defeat ISIS within Syria to stabilize the Syrian country, to avoid further civil war, then work collectively with our partners around the world on political protests that would lead to Assad leaving.” Tillerson said last week that Assad’s political future was a matter for the Syrian people to decide, and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said that defeating the Islamic State was the higher priority. The Obama administration had insisted that Assad could never remain in any postwar Syria, and it supported rebel groups that have tried unsuccessfully to oust him. Also Thursday, a senior State Department official said Tillerson spoke on the phone Wednesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about the chemical attack on civilians in Syria. “We sought the Russian analysis or readout of what they thought had happened,” the official said. The United States has a broad arsenal already in the region, should Trump decide to attack, including dozens of strike aircraft on the USS George H.W. Bush, an aircraft carrier that is deployed to the Middle East and accompanied by guided-missile destroyers and cruisers that can also launch Tomahawk cruise missiles. Additionally, an amphibious naval force in the region that includes the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit could muster Harrier jets and Cobra gunships. The Pentagon also has scores of aircraft in the region flying operations every day against the Islamic State group, including from Incirlik air base to the north in Turkey. The U.S. Central Command has had plans for striking the Syrian government for years, but those plans would potentially need to be tailored to the precise goals of a strike in response to the chemical attack. [‘The hospitals were slaughterhouses’: A journey into Syria’s secret torture wards] Officials said one consideration in examining a possible response is the presence of hundreds of American troops within Syria. Officials said there were measures in place to protect those troops but declined to give details. U.S. aircraft also would have to contend with a modest web of Syrian air defenses and potentially more advanced types of surface-to-air missiles provided by Russia. One of Assad’s more prevalent systems, the S-200, was used to target Israeli jets last month, but missiles were intercepted by Israeli defense systems. The S-200 has a range of roughly 186 miles, according to U.S. military documents, and can hit targets flying at altitudes of around 130,000 feet. Russian S-300 and S-400 missiles, located primarily around Khmeimim air base in western Syria, have a shorter range than the S-200, but have more-advanced radar systems and fly considerably faster than their older counterparts used by Syrian forces. The S-300 has a range of roughly 90 miles and could also be used to target incoming U.S. cruise missiles. Sen. John McCain (R.-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an interview Thursday that he and Trump have discussed Syria in the past few days, but he said the president did not talk in particular about military options. McCain, who has long backed a more aggressive response to the Assad government, laid out a short list of goals if the United States strikes. world national-security Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

McCain said he was glad to see Trump’s position on striking Assad changing. “I know that he was deeply moved, as we all were, at the spectacle of this slaughter,” McCain said.

      "text" : "One of the earliest and most prominent startups of the so-called “sharing economy” or “gig economy” is evaluating the possibility of selling itself. As reported by Recode, freelance work marketplace TaskRabbit acknowledged that it is contemplating a sale after receiving inbound interest from a possible strategic buyer.TaskRabbit launched in early 2008 as a way to match up with various types of odd jobs in their local area part-time workers who had spare time. In its earliest days, the business operated in a very loose marketplace model — users could list jobs they needed accomplished and the price they were willing to pay for those services, and so-called “TaskRabbits” could choose to accept those jobs or not.\nIt was a pretty novel concept at the time, but it wasn’t long before a number of other startups cropped up offering similar capabilities. Over time, those gig economy companies started to position themselves around specific types of work, with many attempting to be the place to go for cleaning services or home improvement.\nA few more years passed, and, after some initial excitement around the gig economy, follow-on venture capital dried up and many of TaskRabbit’s competitors either shut down or were acquired for pennies on the dollar.\nAnd so here we are. After raising $38 million dollars from investors like Shasta Ventures, Founders Fund, First Round, Floodgate, CollabFund and others, there’s little appetite for other investors to keep putting money in companies like TaskRabbit.\nSo what now? All indications are that handyman services, light home renovation and furniture assembly are going to end up being a billion-dollar business. So it makes sense that TaskRabbit would explore the possibility of a sale if there’s a buyer — or multiple buyers — interested.\nThe only question is who those buyers might be, and how much they might be willing to pay for the business.

(Fox Business Network) President Trump spoke with Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo in an interview airing Wednesday morning, and it was par for the course for Trump. By which I mean he rewrote history (on his views of attacking Syria), offered some cryptic comments (about FBI Director James Comey's job), and appeared to completely reverse course on strategy (saying he now wants to finish health-care reform before tax reform). He even appeared to brag about striking Syria while eating dessert with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Below is the full transcript, with the key parts highlighted and analyzed. To see an annotation, click on the yellow parts. TRUMP: Well, look, you know because you cover it. We've done an amazing job on regulations. We've freed it up. We freed up this country so much, the miners and energy and the banking system is now coming, too, with Dodd-Frank, which is a disaster. We freed up so much and we're getting great, great credit for it. We have done so much for so many people. I don't think that there is a presidential period of time in the first 100 days where anyone has done nearly what we've been able to do. And on top of it, we just had — during the first 100 days, a Supreme Court justice approved, not just nominated, but approved through a very, very hostile environment. We have thousands of jobs all across the country. Look at what's going on in Michigan with the expansion of the plants by Ford, by General Motors, yesterday Toyota announced that they're going to spend $1.3 to $1.9 billion in Kentucky. And different things. I mean the car industry is not going to leave us anymore, believe me. The car industry is staying in our country. They were leaving — if I didn't win this election, you would have lost your car industry to Mexico and to other countries. They're not leaving anymore, believe me. There's retribution if they leave. There was no retribution. BARTIROMO: Right. TRUMP: They'd leave, they would sell their cars in, they'd fire all our people. Now, there's retribution. And they understand that. Now, at the same time, I'm going to treat them great. But we want them to expand their plants and build new plants and that's what they're doing. TRUMP: Yes, I am waiting right now for so many people. BARTIROMO: You're under staffed. TRUMP: Hundreds and hundreds of people. And then they'll say, why isn't Trump doing this faster? You can't do it faster, because they're obstructing. They're obstructionists. So I have people — hundreds of people that we're trying to get through. I mean you have — you see the backlog. We can't get them through. BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP: And then the newspapers will say Trump doesn't get them through. Well, not — nothing to do with me. Statutorily, you have to go through this process. So it's been a lousy process. It's taken a long time to get my cabinet done. And as you know, it's not even done now. This is records stuff. You know, we're talking about records in terms of time. And it's very sad. Well, you see, even again, with the Supreme Court judge that everybody agrees is outstanding and you see what that process was. BARTIROMO: Absolutely. And the American people know it, I think. TRUMP: I think they know it. I think they get it. I wish it would be explained better, the obstructionist nature, though, because a lot of times I'll say why doesn't so and so have people under him or her? The reason is because we can't get them approved. BARTIROMO: Well, people are still wondering, though, they're scratching their heads, right, so many Obama-era staffers are still here. For example, was it a mistake not to ask Jim Comey to step down from the FBI at the outset of your presidency? Is it too late now to ask him to step down? TRUMP: No, it's not too late, but, you know, I have confidence in him. We'll see what happens. You know, it's going to be interesting. But, you know, we have to just — look, I have so many people that want to come into this administration. They're so excited about this administration and what's happening — bankers, law enforcement — everybody wants to come into this administration. Don't forget, when Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton. People don't realize that. He saved her life, because — I call it Comey won. And I joke about it a little bit. When he was reading those charges, she was guilty on every charge. And then he said, she was essentially OK. But he — she wasn't OK, because she was guilty on every charge. And then you had two and then you had three. But Hillary Clinton won — or Comey won. She was guilty on every charge. BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP: So Director Comey... BARTIROMO: Well, that's (INAUDIBLE)... TRUMP: No, I'm just saying... BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE)? TRUMP: Well, because I want to give everybody a good, fair chance. Director Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton, that I can tell you. If he weren't, she would be, right now, going to trial. BARTIROMO: Are you going to push that? Are you going to put... TRUMP: No, I don't want to talk about that, I want to talk about (INAUDIBLE). BARTIROMO: Mr. President, just a final question for you. In the last weeks of the Obama presidency, he changed all the rules in terms of the intelligence agencies, allowing them to share raw data. TRUMP: Terrible. BARTIROMO: Why do you think he did this? TRUMP: Well, I'm going to let you figure that one out. But it's so obvious. When you look at Susan Rice and what's going on, and so many people are coming up to me and apologizing now. They're saying you know, you were right when you said that. Perhaps I didn't know how right I was, because nobody knew the extent of it. (INAUDIBLE)... BARTIROMO: When you sent that... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: — what they did... BARTIROMO: — was that what you were referring to, the Susan Rice? TRUMP: Oh, sure. We're talking about surveillance. It was wiretapped in quotes. \"The New York Times\" said the word wiretapped in the headline of the first edition. Then they took it out of there fast when they realized. But I put wiretapped in quotes, meaning, because, look, wiretapping is an old-fashioned... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: — there are too many wires anymore, right? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: You don't have a lot of wires. Look at this room. This room used to have a lot of wires. Now it doesn't have so many wires. But we talked about surveillance or whatever. And you look at the extent of the surveillance. Me and so many other people, it's terrible. BARTIROMO: She said she didn't do it for political reasons. Susan Rice... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: — does anybody really believe that? Nobody believes that, even the people that try to protect her in the news media. It's such a big story and I'm sure it will continue forward. But what they did is horrible. TRUMP: Well, I think many. We are going to have we are going to have tax reform at some point very soon. I think we're doing very well on health care. It's been very much misreported that we failed with health care. We haven't failed, we're negotiating and we continue to negotiate and we will save perhaps $900 billion. You know, if you look at the kind of numbers that we're talking about, that's all going back into the taxes. And we have to do health care first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform. So we're going to have a phenomenal tax reform. But I have to do health care first. I want to do it first to really do it right. Health care has been going along — you know, it's in negotiations (INAUDIBLE) and it's just a negotiation. And it's going to take a little while longer, but as you're probably hearing, Congress is coming along. We have some great people in Congress. They want it to happen. We will have no Democrats. Zero. That means we have to get close to 100 percent of the Republicans, not an easy way to run a government. You saw that with Justice Gorsuch, which is — who we're very proud of. He had no — almost no Democratic support, even though he was central casting, like the perfect Supreme Court judge. So we'll see what happens. I think we're doing very well with health care, which surprises — that's like breaking news, but they all know it, they just don't tend to write it. And after that, we're going to start on tax reform and infrastructure. BARTIROMO: But do you have to do health care before tax reform... TRUMP: Yes. BARTIROMO: When I speak with business managers, they say tax reform is so much more impactful to moving the needle on economic growth... TRUMP: And they're right. They're all right. But because I'm saving a tremendous amount — hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars we're saving on health care. So we're going to have a much better plan than ObamaCare, which is failing. Even now, as I came in here, they're saying payments have to be made that weren't scheduled to be made on ObamaCare. If you don't make them, it fails. I mean, you know, it's just a mess. ObamaCare is a total mess. So we're serving tremendous amounts of money on health care when we get this done, number one. And most importantly, actually, we're going to have great health care. And all of that saving goes into the tax. If you don't do that, you can't put any of the savings into the tax cuts and the tax reform. BARTIROMO: How do you know you're not going to have a similar battle on the tax... TRUMP: Oh, I will. BARTIROMO: — (INAUDIBLE) to be, because you've got a border adjustment tax... TRUMP: I will. BARTIROMO: — the deductions, so... TRUMP: That's right. BARTIROMO: — who's to say that tax reform doesn't fail the way the bill — the House bill did? TRUMP: I think tax reform will be easier, but it's going to be tough. You have a lot of people out there that want — you know, they have their own agendas, including a lot of supporters of different people that are in Congress. They have their own agendas. They want certain things. Tax reform is going to be tough, but it won't be as tough as health care. Health care is very, very difficult. You look at that, look at Hillary Clinton failed and you look at so many of the others. And ObamaCare failed. ObamaCare was just, you know, they just, in the end, just gave up just to get the vote. You look at what they had to do in Nebraska, where they essentially gave it away to Nebraska to get that final vote. BARTIROMO: And we know the premiums up 116 percent (INAUDIBLE)... TRUMP: The premiums, oh, the premiums... BARTIROMO: — in Arizona and across the country. TRUMP: Are many, many of the — and this is going to be a much worse year than last year for ObamaCare. So ObamaCare is a disaster. It's really gone. Essentially, it's gone. If ObamaCare isn't bailed out almost on a monthly basis, it fails. It immediately fails. We have a great health care plan that I think will happen and if it happens, then I go immediately to tax reform. And that will happen. That will be easier than health care. BARTIROMO: How are you on the border adjustment tax? Have you decided? TRUMP: I haven't really wanted to talk about it. I have my own feelings. I don't like the word adjustment, because our country gets taken advantage of, to use a nice term, by every other country in the world. So when I hear border adjustment, adjustment means we lose. We lose. So I don't like the term border adjustment. BARTIROMO: Any tax at the border? TRUMP: Weak. Let's call it an import tax. Let's call it a reciprocal tax. You know, we have... BARTIROMO: So it's in there. You want a... TRUMP: We have countries, Maria, that charge us — our companies — 100 percent tax if they sell a motorcycle or if they sell — they make it in America, they make it in the United States, they sell it various countries. They sell very low, because the tax is 100 percent in some countries. The tax is 50 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent. But if they make a motorcycle and they sell it back into the United States, they have no tax. And do you think that's fair? And do you think that's smart? So I love the idea of reciprocal. You can call it a reciprocal or a matching tax or a mirror tax. There are numerous terms. BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP: But the reciprocal tax is very important. And you know the funny thing is that nobody gets angry when you say reciprocal tax. When you say we're going to charge a border tax — we'd be a rich nation if we did it, by the way... BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE). TRUMP: — but, you know... BARTIROMO: It sounds easier (INAUDIBLE)... TRUMP: — but that — nobody cares about that. But when you say reciprocal, nobody fights you. When you say I'm going to charge a 10 percent or a 20 percent border tax, everyone goes crazy, because they like free trade. Well, they don't say that the other countries are charging you much more than that. But when you say a reciprocal tax — and I'm not saying that's what I'm doing, but there has to be a certain reciprocal nature to it. But when you say reciprocal tax, nobody can get angry. Even the other countries, if like — if they're charging you a 50 percent tax, you say, OK, whatever you charge, we're charging. BARTIROMO: Like China and Indiana. TRUMP: They may not like it, but they can't get angry because they can't win that battle. BARTIROMO: What if you have a debate, you can't get to an agreement on that, do you prefer just cutting taxes? If you had to one, can you do just... TRUMP: Yes, well, we... BARTIROMO: — corporate tax cuts? TRUMP: — could keep trade and we could keep certain things separate. We may put it in the tax code or we may keep it separate. We have a lot of different things. And don't forget, we're going to be bringing back, as part of this, I think the number is closer — closer to $5 trillion. You know, you've been hearing — you've been using — and you keep using it, $2.5 trillion, right? BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE). TRUMP: But the money — the corporate inversions and the money over there is $2.5 trillion. So I think that money — because we've been saying that number for, what, five years now, would you say? So I know it's much more. It's probably $5 trillion or $4 trillion. That money is coming back. We're going to charge a very small tax on that money and the companies are going to bring that money back into the United States and do lots of good things with it. Right now, they can't bring it back. And it's not only the high techs, it's also because the bureaucracy is so horrible. I have friends who want to bring money back. Even if they were willing to pay the tax, which very few people are willing, the bureaucracy, the paperwork, the work to get it in, it's not worth it. BARTIROMO: Which is why you're rolling back these (INAUDIBLE)... TRUMP: Oh, I'm... (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: — through your executive orders. You're rolling back regulations. TRUMP: I have gotten... BARTIROMO: So if you had to do one... TRUMP: — rid of regulations... BARTIROMO: — corporate tax or individual tax, what's more important, if you had to do one this year? TRUMP: Both. Both. BARTIROMO: Both? TRUMP: Both. I almost think individual from my standpoint, because, you know, the middle class has just been taken advantage of in this country for so many years. But in terms of jobs, I mean I think both, but I think probably corporate. But they kind of both go hand in hand. It's not going to matter. BARTIROMO: Have you moved off of this soft deadline that your team put in place of August to get this done? Are you looking at the — later in the year? TRUMP: Well, you know, I put a deadline on health care and the fake news immediately went crazy, because when I didn't make the deadline, although I was... (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: — negotiating — don't forget, I said — and it's true, I didn't even say take a vote. I say withdraw. Well, that same thing is being negotiated and great points are being won and lost, but great points are being won that are going to lower premiums and make our health care incredible. But by putting a deadline, they say, oh, Trump didn't make it, he didn't make it. Now, look, so I don't want to put deadlines. Health care is going to happen at some point. Now, if it doesn't happen fast enough, I'll start the taxes. But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do health care first. BARTIROMO: What about infrastructure? How do you see it, when do you see it? TRUMP: A hundred percent. Very soon. I see it as part, perhaps, of the health care plan, because phase two of the health care plan, in order to get the votes, I need 60 percent for that and if I put that in, the Democrats are actually going to love the infrastructure plan. So we're going to actually — I believe, despite their tremendous hostility for years — this isn't just for Trump. This is for years it's been so hostile. You know, Maria, when I used to come to Washington, because I've been a very political person all my life, even though not on this side of the equation. But I've been very, very political. I used to see Democrats and Republicans. They were best friends. And they'd fight a little bit during the day and then they'd have dinner with their families at night. You'd see them at restaurants. I used to joke with the business and, you know, Republicans... BARTIROMO: They would have a coffee together? TRUMP: Yes, they'd be together. They'd have breakfast together. And then they go and fight and then they have lunch. Today, you don't see that. The level of hatred is incredible. And I'm not just saying in the last 90 days, I'm saying this has been for the last few years. It's incredibly divisive. BARTIROMO: Has it gotten in the way of getting things done? TRUMP: Well, as an example, on health care, I won't get one Democrat vote, even though many of them think it's an incredible plan. Take a look at Justice Gorsuch. You can't get better. Top of the line in every aspect. And he got three votes from the Democrats. He should have gotten all of them. He got three votes. And those three people, you know, are to be respected for doing it. But it's — there's a great level of hostility and they're putting their hatred way, way above — way above the country and the benefit to the country that, you know, things that they do can have such benefit. So I probably — I always assume no Democrat votes. Now, the good thing is we have the House. We have the Senate. And we have the White House. So we're all set. But within there, you have certain factions. You have the conservative Republicans. You have the moderate Republicans and you have to get them together. But we need close to 100 percent. That's a pretty hard thing to get. But we get it. TRUMP: OK, just so you understand, we're not going into Syria, because, you know, there were some questions. Nikki Haley is doing a great job. Rex is doing a fantastic job, our secretary of State. General McMaster, fantastic. But if you add it all up and if they take every little word, they'll say oh, they're different. Just so you understand, we're not going into Syria. But when I see people using horrible, horrible chemical weapons, which they agreed not to use under the Obama administration, but they violated it. BARTIROMO: They said they got rid of them. TRUMP: Look, what I did should have been done by the Obama administration a long time before I did it and you would have had a much better — I think Syria would be a lot better off right now than it has been. BARTIROMO: Obama pushed... TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE). BARTIROMO: — he resisted doing it. TRUMP: When I looked, he — well, he didn't do it. BARTIROMO: Right. TRUMP: I don't know what happened, but he didn't do it. And in fact, they had a big attack right after he drew the red line in the sand. They had a very big attack and everybody waited, what's going on, and nothing happened. And even the Obama people admitted he was wrong for not doing it. I will tell you that when I looked at the pictures on any show or any newspaper, but especially when you see them on television... BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE). TRUMP: — and you see these beautiful kids that are dead in their father's arms, or you see kids gasping for life and you know they're — it's over. It's over for them. They're hosing them down, hundreds of them. When you see that, I immediately called General Mattis. I said, what can we do? And they came back with a number of different alternatives. And we hit them very hard. Now, are we going to get involved with Syria? No. But if I see them using gas and using things that — I mean even some of the worst tyrants in the world didn't use the kind of gases that they used. And some of the gases are unbelievably potent. So when I saw that, I said we have to do something. BARTIROMO: Does the strike against Syria give more leverage to Rex Tillerson ahead of his meeting with his counterpart in Russia? TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know. I can't tell you. But I'll let you know soon, because they're going to be finishing that meeting pretty soon. Rex is doing an outstanding job. He's been — he's got a great sense. Look, he ran ExxonMobil for many years and it was flawlessly run. And he's doing a really, really good job. We're proud of him. But he's over in Russia. He's going soon. He's going to have meetings and then he's coming back and I'll certainly let us know. BARTIROMO: What's the message that you want him to deliver... TRUMP: Well, I think the message is... BARTIROMO: — to the Russians? TRUMP: — number one, you should have peace in Syria. It's enough. And frankly, you know, we talked the chemicals, because, you know, people just don't see this, the level of brutality, the level of viciousness. But when they drop barrel bombs and bombs of any kind right on top of a civilian population, that's the worst thing — I've never seen anything like it. And frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person. And I think it's very bad for Russia. I think it's very bad for mankind. It's very bad for this world. But when you drop gas or bombs or barrel bombs — they have these massive barrels with dynamite and they drop them right in the middle of a group of people. And in all fairness, you see the same kids — no arms, no legs, no face. This is an animal. And I really think that there's going to be a lot of pressure on Russia to make sure that peace happens, because, frankly, if Russia didn't go in and back this animal, you wouldn't have a problem right now. He was going to be overthrown. I thought he was gone. He had another week. I mean he was finished. He had nothing, nothing. And then Russia came in and saved him. And then Obama made one of the worst deals in history with the Iran deal. So you really have Iran and you have Russia and you have Assad. BARTIROMO: You redirected navy ships to go toward the Korean Peninsula. What we are doing right now in terms of North Korea? TRUMP: You never know, do you? You never know. BARTIROMO: That's all (INAUDIBLE)... TRUMP: You know I don't think about the military. BARTIROMO: Yes. TRUMP: I'm not like Obama, where they talk about in four months we're waiting — we're going to hit Mosul. BARTIROMO: Right. TRUMP: And in the meantime, they get ready and like you've never seen — look, they're still fighting. Mosul was supposed to last for a week and now they've been fighting it for many months and so many more people died. I don't want to talk about it. We are sending an armada, very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you. And we have the best military people on Earth. And I will say this. He is doing the wrong thing. He is doing the wrong thing. BARTIROMO: Do you... TRUMP: He's making a big mistake. BARTIROMO: — do you think he's mentally fit? TRUMP: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know him. But he's doing the wrong thing. I have a very, very good meeting with President Xi of China. I really liked him. We had a great chemistry, I think. I mean at least I had a great chemistry — maybe he didn't like me, but I think he liked me. We were going to have a 10 or a 15 minute sit-down. It lasted for three hours. Then the next day, it was another schedule, because everything is very orderly with the Chinese, frankly. And we had meetings scheduled. Well, the 15 minutes on the first day lasted for three hours. The 15 minutes on the second day lasted for two hours, just one-on-one, the two of us with interpreters. And I mean we understand each other. I think he's, you know, a person that I got along with really well. We had a good chemistry, yes. BARTIROMO: Did he give you any suggestion that he would help... TRUMP: Well... BARTIROMO: — with North Korea? TRUMP: We had the meeting. BARTIROMO: Did you get into trade and currency? TRUMP: The first thing I brought up was North Korea. I said you've got to help us with North Korea, because we can't allow it. And it's not good for you. And you have a tremendous power because of trade. Now, he then explains thousands of years of history with Korea. Not that easy. In other words, not as simple as people would think. They've had tremendous conflict with Korea over the years. Now, his father was in China four times. He was never in China. So I said, look, you have a tremendous power because of trading through the border. If they don't get food, they don't get, you know, they can't sell their coal. In fact, I hear today two massive coal ships from North Korea were sent back to North Korea, heading to China. They were sent back, which is a very good sign. But I think China can help us. I hope China can help us. We talked about trade and I can tell you, China will do much better on trade if they help us with North Korea. BARTIROMO: And you think he knows that? TRUMP: I think he knows that. I told him that, yes. BARTIROMO: When you were with the president of China, you're launching these military strikes. TRUMP: Yes. BARTIROMO: Was that planned? How did that come about that it's happening right then, because right there, you're saying a reminder, here's who the superpower in the world is, right? TRUMP: You have no idea how many people want to hear the answer to this. I have had — I have watched speculation for three days now on what that was like (INAUDIBLE). BARTIROMO: When did you tell him? TRUMP: But I'll tell you (INAUDIBLE)... BARTIROMO: Before dessert or what? TRUMP: But I will tell you, only because you've treated me so good for so long, I have to (INAUDIBLE) right? I was sitting at the table. We had finished dinner. We're now having dessert. And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen and President Xi was enjoying it. And I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded, what do you do? And we made a determination to do it, so the missiles were on the way. And I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you. This was during dessert. We've just fired 59 missiles, all of which hit, by the way, unbelievable, from, you know, hundreds of miles away, all of which hit, amazing. BARTIROMO: Unmanned? Brilliant. TRUMP: It's so incredible. It's brilliant. It's genius. Our technology, our equipment, is better than anybody by a factor of five. I mean look, we have, in terms of technology, nobody can even come close to competing. Now we're going to start getting it, because, you know, the military has been cut back and depleted so badly by the past administration and by the war in Iraq, which was another disaster. So what happens is I said we've just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq and I wanted you to know this. And he was eating his cake. And he was silent. BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) to Syria? TRUMP: Yes. Heading toward Syria. In other words, we've just launched 59 missiles heading toward Syria. And I want you to know that, because I didn't want him to go home. We were almost finished. It was a full day in Palm Beach. We're almost finished and I — what does he do, finish his dessert and go home and then they say, you know, the guy you just had dinner with just attacked a country? BARTIROMO: How did he react? TRUMP: So he paused for 10 seconds and then he asked the interpreter to please say it again. I didn't think that was a good sign. And he said to me, anybody that uses gases — you could almost say or anything else — but anybody that was so brutal and uses gases to do that young children and babies, it's OK. politics the-fix Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

      "text" : "MOSCOW — After Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson waited for much of the day, wondering whether he would get to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin, the two men sat down at the Kremlin late Wednesday afternoon in the first face-to-face meeting between the Russian leader and a top official in the Trump administration.Relations between the United States and Russia have grown so tense that it was unclear whether Mr. Putin would agree to see Mr. Tillerson, a man he once gave a medal of friendship.Their meeting lasted almost two hours and ended just before 8 p.m. local time.In the 24 hours before Mr. Tillerson landed in Moscow, the White House accused Mr. Putin’s government of covering up evidence that the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for sarin gas attacks on its own people, launched from a base where Russian troops are operating.Mr. Putin shot back that the charge was fabricated and accused the administration of President Trump, who American intelligence agencies believe benefited from Russian cyberattacks intended to embarrass his Democratic rival during the election campaign, of fabricating the evidence to create a fake confrontation.“This reminds me very much of the events of 2003, when U.S. representatives in the Security Council showed alleged chemical weapons discovered in Iraq,” Mr. Putin said, referring to an intelligence failure that Mr. Trump has also cited in recent months. “The exact same thing is happening now,” he charged.He quoted two Russian writers, Ilya Ilf and Yevgeni Petrov, authors of the 1928 satire “The 12 Chairs,” and said, “ ‘It’s boring, ladies.’ We have seen this all before.”But the diplomatic theater playing out in Moscow on a rainy Wednesday morning was far from boring: Mr. Putin, operating on home turf, was looking for any way to shape the narrative of Mr. Tillerson’s first trip here as secretary of state.The outcome could well decide whether Mr. Trump’s oft-stated desire to remake American relations with Moscow will now disintegrate, just as similar efforts by Barack Obama did early in his presidency.Russia said earlier this week that Mr. Putin would not meet with Mr. Tillerson, but on Wednesday the Russian leader’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, held out the possibility of a meeting later in the day. Russian leaders have greeted virtually all new secretaries of state since the end of World War II, but Mr. Peskov said any meeting would depend on how Mr. Tillerson’s other talks went.The drama appeared to be an effort by Mr. Putin to show that he was in control.Critics of the Trump administration insist that the series of events around the attack in Syria had been meant to distract from the investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.Mr. Tillerson, who was recognized with an Order of Friendship medal by the Russian government while he was the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has insisted on a tough line on Russia, ruling out any early end to sanctions unless the country returns Crimea to Ukraine and ceases meddling elsewhere.On Syria, Mr. Tillerson delivered what sounded much like an ultimatum to the Russians on Tuesday while talking to reporters at a Group of 7 meeting in Italy.“I think it is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,” Mr. Tillerson said, echoing a theme first heard from Mr. Obama in 2011, when the Arab Spring led many to believe the Syrian leader was about to be overthrown.Mr. Tillerson essentially demanded that Russia make a choice, severing ties with Mr. Assad and working with the United States on a variety of initiatives in the Middle East.But Mr. Putin and his acolytes in the Russian government see the situation very differently. They regard their military intervention in Syria, which the Obama administration did not see coming, as a tactical success.They shored up Mr. Assad and made him dependent on Russia’s presence. That, in turn, assured Russia’s continued access to its naval station in Syria, a move that was critical to the country’s efforts to project power in the Middle East.As Mr. Tillerson entered the foreign ministry here to meet his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, an experienced and wily veteran of many of Russia’s post-Cold War encounters with Washington, the Russian government released another salvo against American intentions here.The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria V. Zakharova, said it was “useless” for Mr. Tillerson to arrive in Moscow with “ultimatums” and suggested that if he wanted any progress, he should start by getting Mr. Trump and his administration on the same page about Syria strategy.“It is not clear what they will do in Syria and not only there,” she said on Dozhd, Russia’s independent television network. “Nobody understands what they will do in the Middle East because it is a very complicated region, forgive me for saying such a banal thing. Nobody understands what they will do with Iran, what they will do with Afghanistan.”Then, to suggest this was a symptom of broader disorganization, she added, “Nobody understands what they will do with North Korea.”Mr. Tillerson had hoped, several weeks ago, to make the battle against the Islamic State a focus of this trip, working with Russia to seal off the last escape routes from Raqqa, in hopes of killing the remainder of the Islamic State force there.Instead, the chemical attack in Syria — and the investigations into how and how significantly Mr. Putin interfered in the United States presidential election — have overshadowed what Mr. Tillerson has insisted remains the No. 1 priority: defeating the Islamic State.There was some suggestion by the Russians that Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Tillerson would talk about no-fly zones, one way of keeping Mr. Assad’s air force grounded. But it is unclear how that would work, and the prospect of confrontation between American and Russian forces would be significant as the no-fly zone was enforced.Meanwhile, Mr. Putin went on Mir TV to suggest two theories about how the sarin gas attack might not have been the responsibility of Mr. Assad. He said that there was evidence, which he did not specify, that the shells hit a bunker of chemical weapons, a view that other Russian officials have expressed previously. The United States rejected this conclusion when it declassified intelligence assessments on Tuesday.The second theory Mr. Putin offered was that “this was all staged, in other words this was a provocation.” “This was deliberately done to create noise and pretext, for additional pressure on the legitimate Syrian government,” he said. “That’s all. This needs to be checked. Without a check we don’t think it is possible to make any steps against the official Syrian government.”Mr. Tillerson has all but called that theory fake news.",

      "text" : "CHAMBLEE, Ga. — Volunteers for Democrat Jon Ossoff — mostly youthful, clad in navy blue T-shirts and carrying bundles of door-knocking materials — rushed excitedly around a low-slung campaign outpost here Tuesday to stoke turnout before polling locations close at 7 p.m. in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. That energy, a bustling example of the groundswell of grass-roots liberal activism that has poured into this special House election in the wealthy Atlanta suburbs, may not be enough for Ossoff, a 30-year-old former congressional staffer, to prevail and capture a seat that has been in GOP hands since 1979. For Ossoff to win outright Tuesday night and avoid a run-off election, where he’d likely face a far more united Republican Party, he needs to garner at least 50 percent of the vote, a tally that many Democrats suggest is possible but far from a sure thing. Working in Democrats’ favor is a splintered GOP, whose 11 candidates for an open House seat previously held by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price have given Ossoff his chance to deliver an unwelcome blow less than 100 days into President Trump’s tenure. White House officials, such as chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, are paying close attention to the Georgia contest, well aware of the implications for Trump’s political capital as he attempts to jolt his stalled agenda in the coming months, in particular with wary Republicans. They have also encouraged the president to intervene. Who is Jon Ossoff? Embed Copy Share Play Video2:09 (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Jon Ossoff, a former congressional aide, is running for the seat of former Republican congressman Tom Price in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. Here’s what you need to know about him. Jon Ossoff, a former congressional aide, is running for the seat of former Republican congressman Tom Price in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Earlier Tuesday, Trump tweeted that Republicans “must get out today and VOTE in Georgia 6” and warned that “Dem Ossoff will raise your taxes” and is “very bad on crime.” At Ossoff’s cramped phone bank in Chamblee, situated between dental offices and piled with doughnut boxes and campaign posters, his staffers joked Tuesday that the tweets amounted to an in-kind contribution that they hoped would incite their party’s base to show up. Trump’s messages also reflected how this once sleepy race is now at the center of the political universe. “The campaign has taken on a life of its own,” said Ossoff aide Alyssa Castillo, 20, who works in public relations for a distribution center in DeKalb County. “Whatever happens, this is the start of something bigger, that’s for sure.” Robin Lourie, a 54-year-old attorney and independent, said she was volunteering for Ossoff “because of Trump.” “I was shocked last year, extremely shocked,” she said of the president’s victory. “I think liberty and equality is at stake in this country and so although I’ve voted for Republicans before, I had to do something. A lot of people feel the same way.” Democrats here and nationally see the race as a chance to the upend the national political landscape Tuesday, should Ossoff hit the 50-percent mark by night’s end. Doing so would rouse their demoralized party just five months after Trump won the White House and stoke the burgeoning anti-Trump movement. Ahead of next year’s mid-term elections, they also see an opportunity to raise expectations about possibly winning back majorities in Congress. But if Ossoff narrowly misses reaching 50 percent, Democrats said they would move still move to frame such a showing a referendum on Trump as he nears the 100-day mark of a presidency so far defined by an early stumble on health-care legislation and a GOP split into warring factions. Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff is ahead in many polls. (Kevin Liles/Reuters) In the final, frantic hours of canvassing and phone calls, avoiding a run-off was the priority. “No run-off, vote for Ossoff,” read one poster at the Chamblee office. “Look at the map,” Tish Naghise, an Ossoff field organizer, said as she pointed to a green layout of the district on the wall. “Hillary Clinton came close to winning here but you have to do really well in Chamblee and Tucker, do well in diverse areas, if you’re going to have a shot of competing throughout this whole area.” Most swaths of this sprawling suburban bastion of college-educated white professionals lean conservative Republican and Ossoff could find it difficult in to sustain the swirling momentum that has propelled him this past week. Veteran consultants from both parties expect GOP voters in the district to coalesce around whomever emerges from the 11 Republicans who are lagging behind Ossoff and splitting the party’s vote after weeks of squabbling. Per Georgia law, the run-off ballot features the two top finishers from the crowded non-partisan primary, which called after Price, who had represented the district since 2005, vacated the seat to become Trump’s secretary of health and human services. Ossoff, a former congressional staffer and political novice who catapulted to national notice and has been ubiquitous on cable television, has raised more than $8 million and drawn heavy support from prominent Democrats and liberal organizers. His insurgency follows a Democrat’s strong showing last week in a special House election in Kansas that drew far less party money and outside support. The Republican slate in the 6th district has been roiled in recent weeks by nerves about Trump and lingering internecine dramas over ideological purity and local loyalties. “Having 11 people on our side is like eating our young,” Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a friend of Trump, said in an interview. He compared the infighting to the “nightmare” of his own 2014 statewide primary and added: “You risk letting the Democrat slide through without a runoff. But I don’t think that will happen if we get the turnout.” Trump has become a complicated figure in establishment Republican enclaves such as Chamblee, which boasts a tony retail center with a gourmet doughnut shop and a sleek Mexican restaurant whose patio is packed in the evenings with 30-something couples. Walking through leafy neighborhoods, one sees a slew of navy-blue Ossoff signs dotting sidewalks and apartment windows. Republicans’ failure to pass their plan to overhaul the nation’s health-care system has sown doubts among some suburban GOP voters about Trump’s effectiveness in cutting deals with lawmakers in Washington, as well as the party’s promises. The National Republican Congressional Committee has dispatched staffers to Georgia to boost turnout among core GOP voters amid those grumbles. The Congressional Leadership Fund, an outfit aligned with the House GOP, has spent more than $2 million on a spate of negative television spots about Ossoff. The district is “a little bit of an oddity,” said Ralph Reed, a conservative leader and longtime strategist in both Georgia and national Republican circles. “Just in its socioeconomic profile, it doesn’t really lay out as Trump country. It’s highly educated, upscale, suburban, and Trump country tends to be more rural to exurban, more high school or only some college.” [Two Republican lawmakers face anger, from their own voters, on health care] The way the Republican contenders are handling Trump and the concurrent rise of populism and moderate angst in the wake of his victory is revealing, even though the names of the near-dozen candidates are unfamiliar. Everyone seems to be laboring, with varying success, to figure out a pitch that pulls together the fractured GOP ranks. Candidates’ interactions with Trump’s political brand have veered from hearty embrace (Dan Moody, Bob Gray, Bruce LeVell, Amy Kremer) to support but not always rah-rah (Karen Handel, Judson Hill) to flat-out defiance (David Abroms). Most of the leading candidates have bounced between those poles depending on the day or the latest controversy. Handel, a favorite of antiabortion activists who has the highest name recognition and once served as Georgia’s secretary of state, said in an interview that she is concentrating on doing her “level best to represent the interests of the 6th District” in her positions rather than linking arms with Trump. Endorsements from prominent Republican players have been scattered to the point of muddying the field. Perdue has backed Moody. Gingrich supports Hill, as does Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.). Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski endorsed LeVell. Former senator Saxby Chambliss is for Handel. But the conservative Club for Growth has opposed Handel and boosted Gray. To counter the club, the Ending Spending advocacy group, which is backed by the billionaire Ricketts family, has poured millions behind Handel’s candidacy. [This cowboy-poet is trying to steal a Republican House seat in Montana] It goes on and on like that further down the line in the state. One group or officeholder goes for Handel, another goes for Gray, another jumps in for Moody or Hill, and Trump supporters of different degrees poke and prod one another on social media. An Emerson College survey released late last week showed Ossoff with 43 percent. Handel garnered 17 percent, Gray (a former local councilman and businessman) 15 percent and Moody (a former state senator) 9 percent. Hill, another former state senator, was at 6 percent. LeVell, an African American jeweler and former Trump campaign adviser, as well as Trump-aligned conservative activist Kremer, have struggled, perhaps showing the difficulty of being a die-hard Trump supporter in a Republican district that’s not dominated by grass-roots nationalism. Abroms, who has campaigned with anti-Trump independent Evan McMullin, has also found it hard to get on the political map. powerpost false endOfArticle true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Gray is seen by Republicans here as having the best shot of outpacing Handel and making a run-off since he has inched up in various polls during the last few days. At Gray’s campaign office in Johns Creek on Tuesday, his effort to tie himself to Trump was obvious. A massive poster of Vice President Mike Pence points at visitors as they enter. To the right, a yard-sign from the Trump campaign is propped up against a stack of Gray for Congress signs. In a conference room, a photo of the President gives a big thumbs-up to phone-banking volunteers.

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcmaster-says-north-koreas-behavior-cant-continue-1492353945WASHINGTON—A senior Trump administration official warned Sunday that North Korea’s provocative behavior “can’t continue,” and said the U.S. is working with partners including China to develop a range of possible responses to future “destabilizing behavior.”“It’s really the consensus with the president, our key allies in the regions—Japan and South Korea in particular, but also the Chinese leadership—that this problem is coming to a head,” White House national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster said on ABC News’s “This Week.”“And so it’s time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully.”His comments came in the wake of a failed North Korean missile test over the weekend. The missile “blew up almost immediately” after it was fired on Sunday morning, U.S. military officials said, less than a day after leader Kim Jong Un paraded a never-before-seen long-range ballistic missile through the streets of Pyongyang.Officials said the missile North Korea tested was probably a medium-range missile, not an inter-continental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. It failed about four to five seconds after launch. A U.S. official said that if Pyongyang had attempted a nuclear test, “then other actions would have been taken from the U.S.” Officials didn’t say what those actions would have been.Taken as a whole, the comments suggested the U.S. was continuing to seek solutions with Beijing as well as longtime allies in the region, short of a military response. The weekend missile test, which one Trump aide on Sunday termed a “fizzle,” appeared to buy more time for those efforts, which officials hope will include increased economic pressure on North Korea from China.Still, Gen. McMaster noted that President Donald Trump had demonstrated in the recent U.S. missile strike on Syria’s Assad regime that he is “clearly comfortable making tough decisions.” In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last Wednesday, Mr. Trump said his recent meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping could yield new opportunities for cooperation in curbing Mr. Kim’s provocations. He suggested he would be willing to be flexible over trade issues with China if it offers more help in putting pressure on Pyongyang.Mr. Trump on Sunday morning suggested on Twitter that China was broadly on board with the administration’s North Korea strategy, writing: “Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We will see what happens!”U.S. officials worried in recent days over signs that North Korea was preparing for a sixth nuclear weapons test, threatening U.S. efforts to develop a longer-term strategy with China. The administration regarded the medium-range missile test as less provocative than a nuclear test, said a foreign policy adviser traveling in the region with Vice President Mike Pence. Still, there’s little reason to think that the North Korean leader will not attempt another nuclear test at some point. “He’s stated that he wants to do both, he wants to do a nuclear test and a missile launch,” the adviser said. “We’ve seen one…doesn’t prevent him from doing the other.”—Jonathan Cheng contributed to this story.

      "text" : "KABUL, Afghanistan — A day after the United States military dropped its most powerful conventional bomb on caves used by Islamic State affiliates in eastern Afghanistan, officials said on Friday that dozens of militants had been killed, but that they were still trying to assess the full extent of the damage. Residents said the blast had been felt tens of miles away.The strike on Thursday targeted a set of mountain tunnels in the Achin district, a stronghold of the Islamic State’s regional affiliate, and it was the first use in combat of the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, referred to as the “mother of all bombs.” The bombing was part of an intense air campaign against the Islamic State, with American airstrikes in Afghanistan averaging as many as 10 a day in the first two weeks of April.Gen. Dawlat Waziri, a spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, said initial information indicated that 36 militants had been killed and three large caves destroyed in the bombing in Nangarhar Province. However, Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor’s office, said 82 militants had been killed.Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said on Friday at a news conference in Kabul, the capital, that the Islamic State was using caves, tunnels and “an extensive belt of improvised explosive devices,” or roadside bombs, to resist Afghan and coalition operations.The general said that he had been in constant touch with his chain of command, but that the decision to deploy such force was shaped by the battlefield realities and not by outside political factors. President Drumpf has given additional authority to military commanders since taking office, but he has not said whether he personally approved Thursday’s bombing mission.“This is the first time we have encountered an extensive obstacle to our progress that was constituted by I.E.D.s, the presence of tunnels and caves, and therefore this was the appropriate weapon to use at this time,” General Nicholson said. “It was the right time to use it tactically against the right target on the battlefield, and it has enabled us to resume our offensive operations.”Local officials in Achin said that Afghan commandos were advancing on the area and that smaller airstrikes had continued Friday morning.“U.S. forces are providing air support and also support on the ground — there are some U.S. advisers with Afghan forces,” said Ismail Shinwari, the district governor of Achin.Ahmad Jawid Salim, a spokesman for the Afghan Army commandos, said that the operation in Achin had been underway for 45 days but that progress had stalled in the Tangi Assadkhel area of the district, where the bomb was dropped. On Sunday, an American special forces soldier, Staff Sgt. Mark R. De Alencar, 37, was killed near there.“Our foreign counterparts used all available weapons” to destroy the Islamic State havens in Tangi Assadkhel, Mr. Salim said. “But because the posts and havens of I.S. were very strong, it was decided to use this big bomb.”Mr. Salim said that the Afghan commandos were given notice that the bomb would be used and that they pulled back about two miles before it was dropped. “We were getting reports minute by minute, and we were aware that the bomb would drop in 30 and then 20 seconds,” he said.There were no initial reports of civilian casualties from the explosion, and Afghan and American military officials said that precautions had been taken to avoid harming noncombatants. Most civilians in Achin have been displaced since 2015, when the Islamic State turned the district into a stronghold.Mr. Salim said that there had been only one civilian family in Tangi Assadkhel, and that it had been evacuated before the strike.But Malik Kamin, a tribal elder from the nearby area of Shadal Bazaar, said some civilians had been in Tangi Assadkhel when the bomb fell. He said commandos who went in after the bomb was dropped had found two disabled women and an elderly man there and brought them to Shadal Bazaar.General Nicholson said there were no indications that civilians had been wounded or killed. There was “surveillance over the area before, during and after the operation, and now we have Afghan and U.S. forces on the site and see no evidence of civilian casualties,” he said at the news conference.The bomb, which was dropped from a cargo plane, weighed about 10 tons, and its force was felt across Achin and even in neighboring districts.One tribal elder who lives less than two miles from Tangi Assadkhel said the blast was so strong that residents of his village thought that it had been the target. Shrapnel and rocks as heavy as five pounds fell on his house, he said. A resident of the nearby Pekhe area said four houses there, about three miles from the blast site, had been destroyed.Both residents spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation if the Islamic State found its way back to their area.Haji Ghalib, governor of Bati Kot, a district about 20 miles from Achin, said he had felt the blast there. “People in other districts also felt it,” he said. “From check posts in Achin some guys called me, and they were asking, ‘What was that?’ It was very big — for a moment, big flames were rising from the mountain, the whole area was bright.”The Islamic State’s regional affiliate in Afghanistan, largely made of former members of the Pakistani Taliban, was rapidly expanding in eastern Afghanistan during much of 2015 and 2016. In March 2016, American military officials estimated that the group had 2,000 to 3,000 fighters across 11 districts.After multiple operations and extensive airstrikes, that number has been reduced to about 700 fighters across three districts, officials say. The efforts involved several ground operations by Afghan soldiers and commandos advised by American military special forces. But they were also accompanied by an intense air campaign that included B-52 bombers last year, staples of the early part of the war that had not been used for many years.The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for several suicide bombings in urban centers, most recently at the gates of the presidential palace in Kabul on Wednesday, an attack that killed at least five people.In the past, urban attacks were often the work of the Haqqani network, a brutal arm of the Taliban. In a sign of the complexity of the war, Afghan and American officials have expressed concern that there might be an overlap in the enabling networks used by the Haqqani group and the Islamic State for bombings in cities.“One of the things we are concerned about, and the reason we think the entire world needs to be focused on Afghanistan, is the potential for convergence among the various terrorist groups in this area,” General Nicholson said.Some of the tunnels and caves in the complex bombed on Thursday dated from the fight against the British Empire, said Mr. Ghalib, the Bati Kot district governor, who was Achin’s governor for years. More tunnels were added during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and still more by the Islamic State.",

      "text" : "In the beginning, you called an airline or travel agent when you wanted to book a trip. But if you’ve done any traveling at all within the last 15 years, you’ve probably come across a fare aggregator or metasearch site. Hundreds of perfectly legitimate ones exist; you’ve undoubtedly heard of Expedia, Priceline and Hotwire, to name three. Does it matter which site you use, or are they all basically the same?These online travel agencies, or O.T.A.s, and search sites scrape data from other sources, reorganize it and present it to you, the user. The two proverbial 800-pound gorillas in the travel world are Expedia Inc. and the Priceline Group. Together, they have a hand in most of the major travel booking sites. I ran through various scenarios — purchasing a flight, a hotel room and a flight, hotel and car package — with the aid of a sampling of those sites: Travelocity (owned by Expedia), Kayak (owned by Priceline) and the newish kid on the block, Hipmunk. I also searched directly with airline and hotel sites. I admit that I went into this informal study expecting prices and options to be more or less the same from site to site. Let’s just say I was surprised by how mistaken I was.Let’s highlight a few features of the sites before getting into the nitty-gritty of travel details. Travelocity offers some nice options for travelers, including a $50 credit and refund of the difference if you can find a cheaper price on a flight, rental car or cruise within 24 hours of booking. It also featured some surprisingly useful travel articles in its “Get Inspired” section, including write-ups on Spanish sparkling wines and ideas for family-friendly locales in Ireland.Kayak is more search engine than travel agent, and its focus seems to have shifted away from flights (more on that later): The site’s default search offering now involves hotels. It also allows you to connect, in most cases, directly to the service provider. If you search for a Hyatt hotel, Kayak will encourage you to book through Priceline, but will also send you to the Hyatt website. Some of its best features are its price predictor tool, which advises you to wait or pull the trigger on a purchase, and its alerts, which will track airfares and hotel prices over time; an email alert option will notify you about price changes and recommend that you buy or wait.Hipmunk incorporates many of Kayak’s features, including alerts, along with a welcome dose of humor (it rates flights in terms of “Agony” — a combination of price, number of stops and total travel time). It also searches Amtrak routes when applicable, and Airbnb listings when you conduct a hotel search. Its flight search interface can be slightly confusing (sometimes it’s hard to tell which airline you’re selecting), but its other benefits make it a viable option.I researched a long-weekend trip from New York City to Chicago from May 26 to 29 using those three sites, as well as individual airline sites. Travelocity offered a fare of $338 for a flight leaving Kennedy Airport around 7 a.m. on Delta and getting back into La Guardia on Spirit Airlines at 9 a.m. on Monday. (For the Spirit-averse, there was an option to bring you back into Newark on United for an additional $6.)Kayak’s lowest advertised flight was on Delta for $362, a notable difference. (Kayak also offers “hacker fares” — flying different legs of a round-trip flight on different airlines — but I couldn’t even find the flight that Travelocity offered me on Kayak.) Hipmunk’s lowest advertised flight was an all-Spirit flight from La Guardia to O’Hare and back for $372.Things got interesting when I searched on the airlines’ websites. The Delta flight Kayak offered me was the same price on the Delta site. With Spirit, though, things were a little wonky. The Travelocity flight that had one Delta leg and one Spirit leg cost just $269 if I booked the individual legs on the Delta and Spirit websites, respectively: saving $69. There was also a big difference with the Spirit flight Hipmunk offered: If booked directly on the Spirit site, the same flight cost $65 less.It’s important to note that Southwest and its system, which allows for many nonstop routes other airlines don’t offer, won’t show its prices on the major search sites; the airline notoriously disallows third parties seeking to monitor its fares. In this scenario, that meant I had to go to Southwest’s site to find a round-trip package for an impressive $296, which includes two checked bags and no change fees.Flights are travel sites’ bread and butter, right? Wrong. Hotels are where the money is. A 2013 Forbes article noted that an astounding 97 percent of Priceline’s revenue came from hotel bookings. Booking.com, which is owned by Priceline, is a big revenue driver and is able to do an enormous volume, as the company doesn’t act as the merchant of record. It simply connects guests with hotels and takes a fee.Let’s get back to our long weekend in Chicago: Hotel selection is a bit more subjective, as more criteria are involved. I searched for a room for two at a four-star property downtown. Travelocity’s first nonsponsored recommendation was a room with a king bed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago, a decent choice, for $149 per night. Kayak’s first suggestion was the Hyatt Regency Chicago (also a king room) for $179 per night. Hipmunk’s top result? The Palmer House (with only a double bed) for $184 per night.All three sites had the Hyatt room for $179. Travelocity had the same deal on the Palmer House, but Kayak shaved off a few bucks, offering the room at $180 per night. As for the Hard Rock Hotel, only Travelocity had the $149 rate; the other sites offered the room at $159.On their own respective sites, the Hyatt and Palmer House rates were the same as the aggregators’. At the Hard Rock Hotel’s site, though, the lowest rate was $169 — undercut by all three aggregator sites. A good strategy can also be to call hotels directly and ask them to match (or beat) rates that you find online. They won’t always oblige, but it doesn’t hurt to try.Let’s book the flight and hotel together and save some big money, shall we? I searched the same Chicago weekend on Travelocity, looking for the same flights and hotels as a package for two people. With taxes and fees, the total came to $1,207, saving ... negative three dollars. That’s right, it was actually more expensive to buy this particular itinerary as a package instead of booking the flights and hotels separately.Hipmunk also offered a package with its preferred hotel, the Palmer House, for $1,310 for two people, saving $82. It’s worth noting, however, that the package included a JetBlue flight, not the lowest-priced Spirit flight that it advertised (which some may consider a plus). It’s also worth noting that to purchase the package Hipmunk directs you to Travelocity.As for Kayak, buying a package that featured its favored hotel, the Hyatt Regency Chicago, wasn’t even available as an option. It did advertise a package at the Palmer House for $1,574, however, a significant markup from Hipmunk’s offering. And while my searches are admittedly a tiny sample relative to Kayak’s vast offerings, I noticed another hiccup on the very next package I selected: the Hyatt Regency O’Hare, advertised at $1,092 total for two people. I clicked on the price and was redirected to JetBlue Vacations, which had the price at $1,306.That was probably an anomaly. (The very next Kayak package I clicked on actually ended up being cheaper than advertised.) But it was also a lesson learned. If you’re looking to save money, don’t take things at face value; results can vary greatly from site to site. Do your research and inquire directly with travel providers in addition to searching the big travel aggregators. They want your business, certainly, but promises of big savings don’t hold up in all cases.",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — When Donald J. Trump was crafting his campaign tax plan last year, one of his top economic advisers proposed an idea that would have made it harder for real estate moguls to use mountains of debt to make deals. Mr. Trump, who made his fortune as a property developer and earned the nickname “the king of debt,” scoffed at the suggestion.“He hated that idea,” said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who counseled Mr. Trump during the campaign.The proposal to scale back interest deductions for companies did not make the cut.As President Trump focuses his attention on overhauling America’s tax code, he has considered turning to the other side of the aisle to reach a bipartisan deal. But an obstacle has already surfaced, dimming the chances that a “grand bargain” will be achieved: Democrats are sounding the alarm that reshaping the tax code presents Mr. Trump’s biggest conflict of interest yet.A tax code overhaul gives Democrats the chance to again bring up Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns and to press for details of how his business deals are financed. That focus could also affect which tax code items, such as interest deductibility, are included in the overhaul.“The American people want to see what this is about,” Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said of Mr. Trump’s presiding over tax code changes. “Are our interests being protected or are these deals that somehow promote his interests?”Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said this week that tax code changes should be delayed until members of Congress can review Mr. Trump’s tax returns to see how an overhaul of the tax code might benefit him. And last week Terri A. Sewell, an Alabama Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, declared at a hearing that it was “imperative to know how such tax reform affects the president.”Mr. Trump, as president, is legally exempt from the kinds of financial conflicts of interest that other government officials are required to avoid. But that has not stopped questions from swirling beyond Democrats about how he and his family could profit from the presidency.“If the tax reform proposals start to have discussions of whether or not to drop certain deductions for the real estate business, or to expand those, that now becomes the entire matter of tax reform,” said Richard Painter, who was President George W. Bush’s ethics lawyer.Referring to Mr. Trump, Mr. Painter added: “He cannot be an honest arbiter.”Mr. Trump has proudly acknowledged that he fights to pay as little tax as possible so that the federal government cannot waste his money. While Mr. Trump’s advisers have said he would not release his tax documents, the financial disclosures and the portions of returns that have been revealed offer hints of his creative use of the tax code that will likely come up as debates over tax code changes intensify.A loss of nearly $1 billion that Mr. Trump booked in 1995, for instance, could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income tax for nearly two decades thanks to a rule that allows net operating losses to be carried forward into future years. Mr. Trump’s campaign tax plan did not call for changes to that provision.Tax provisions that have proved costly to Mr. Trump could be on the table. Last month, a portion of Mr. Trump’s 2005 tax return showed that he paid $31 million as a result of the alternative minimum tax that year. Mr. Trump has called for the elimination of that tax rule.The opportunity to use Mr. Trump as a weapon against a tax overhaul could distort the debate in other ways. After the fight over the “border adjustment” tax, the most contentious topic is the deductibility of net interest expenses, the idea Mr. Moore had unsuccessfully proposed to Mr. Trump.House Republicans, led by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, want to end the practice of allowing businesses to lower their tax bills by deducting interest from their incomes. Instead, companies would be able to immediately write off the costs of equipment expenses. This would generate more than $1 trillion in revenue — roughly the same amount as the border adjustment tax — according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group.“It’s been surprisingly less controversial so far than one would expect considering it’s a $1 trillion tax increase,” said Alan Cole, an economist at the foundation.That is quickly changing. New coalitions are forming to fight back against ending interest deductibility. Some Republicans from rural districts have expressed concern at congressional hearings this week about how scrapping interest deductibility would harm farmers who rely heavily on debt financing. Private equity and real estate lobbyists have also been aggressively mobilizing to resist the potential change.“This is the next large fight,” said James Maloney, vice president for public affairs at the American Investment Council, which lobbies for the private equity industry and considers the treatment of interest as its most pressing issue.So far Mr. Trump has avoided weighing in publicly on the finer details of the tax overhaul, but industries that could be affected by changes to the tax code hope to reap the benefits of having financial interests aligned with those of the president.Matthew Berger, vice president for tax at the National Multifamily Housing Council, an apartment industry group, warned that the tax outline being promoted by House Republicans could cause the tax burdens of real estate developers to spike, potentially dampening growth of new housing projects.But Mr. Berger said he was optimistic that Mr. Trump would not let that happen. “I would hope that his expertise in real estate would make him sensitive to the issues that developers consider,” Mr. Berger said.",

      "text" : "FLANDERS, N.J. — After the embarrassing collapse of their ObamaCare repeal bill, most House Republicans are steering clear of town halls over the two-week April recess.Not Rep. Leonard Lance.The unassuming, moderate New Jersey Republican walked into the lion’s den Wednesday night — the third town hall he’s held in his bucolic congressional district since President Trump took office.Flanked on stage by two police officers, Lance was greeted with boos, jeers and hisses. People in the crowd held up signs of a red thumbs-down when they disagreed. And he was repeatedly heckled and interrupted as he struggled to finish answering constituents’ questions.On at least two occasions, he was drowned out by standing ovations for speakers urging Lance to fight climate change and GOP healthcare plans.“We’re voting you out next year!” one man yelled at Lance as cheers erupted in the room.Addressing his constituent’s “catcall,” Lance replied that “2017 should be a year of governance, not politics.”But for many of the nearly 400 people who packed Mount Olive High School’s performing arts theater on Wednesday, emotions from the bitter 2016 presidential race are still raw.Several attendees told The Hill that frustration, anger, even disbelief that Trump now occupies the White House motivated them to turn out at Lance's town hall.“A lot of it is Donald TrumpDonald TrumpClinton adviser Huma Abedin seeking M for tell-all book: report With Syria chemical attack, another Obama foreign policy deal fails hard Howard Stern: Spicer speaks 'fluent moron' with Hitler gaffe MORE, because I believe Donald Trump ran on fear and he ran on hate. That’s how he became the president and that scares the crap out of me,” said a man who only wanted to be identified as Chris, a counselor who backed Sen. Bernie SandersBernie SandersSanders: Dems need to ‘educate’ voters to win Inside a NJ Republican's furious town hall Sanders: Trump will be a one-term president MORE (I-Vt.) during the election.“If [Lance] aligns himself with Trump’s policies, then I will be prepared to vote him out.”The scene at Lance’s town hall meeting reflects the energy and enthusiasm from Democrats and liberal activists as they fight to block the Trump agenda and unseat any vulnerable Republicans who could help them flip control of the House in 2018.Lance, a former state lawmaker and second-generation New Jersey politician, is one such target — though no major Democrat has jumped in the race to challenge him yet. He easily dispatched his 2016 Democratic challenger, social worker Peter Jacob, by more than 10 percentage points. But his affluent, moderate district — roughly 50 miles west of New York City — went for Democrat Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonClinton adviser Huma Abedin seeking M for tell-all book: report O'Reilly: Hillary Clinton should be doing 'visible charitable work' Comey greenlights TV series to boost FBI's image MORE over Trump, 48.6 percent to 47.5 percent.President Obama and his signature healthcare law are still very popular here.That isn’t lost on the 64-year-old congressman, who was first elected to the House in 2008. A member of the centrist GOP Tuesday Group, Lance voted for the GOP’s repeal-and-replacement bill in the House Energy and Commerce Committee but announced he could not support it on the floor.Three other New Jersey Republicans — Reps. Frank LoBiondo and Chris Smith and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney FrelinghuysenRodney FrelinghuysenInside a NJ Republican's furious town hall Tax march protesters pressure Republicans who called for Trump tax returns Michigan Dems press for Flint aid in spending bill MORE — also publicly opposed the GOP’s American Health Care Act because it would leave a half-million more Garden State residents without health coverage.LoBiondo went the furthest, saying ObamaCare was better than any GOP alternative health plan. A fourth New Jersey Republican, Rep. Tom MacArthur, has been an integral part of the House negotiations given his role as Tuesday Group co-chair.But Lance may be the only New Jersey Republican to host a town hall over the spring recess. Constituents had to sign up for the event on Lance’s website to prove they lived nearby. His office then passed out raffle tickets, and Lance picked tickets out of a box to give everyone a fair shot to ask a question.The questions were all over the map. Lance was pressed on whether Trump should release his tax returns, on internet privacy and on the U.S. missile strike on a Syrian airbase last week. For the record, Lance said Trump should turn over his tax returns but not be forced to. Lance thinks the Federal Trade Commission, not the Federal Communications Commission, should regulate internet service providers. And he urged Trump to seek approval from Congress before carrying out more military strikes against Syrian government forces.But his exchanges with constituents on healthcare got the most heated.“I don’t feel that you’ve represented my interests or the majority of the constituents that are in your district, ” Janet Katz, a Chester Township resident, told Lance. “I want this repeal crap to stop!”Lance pledged that he wouldn’t support any GOP health bill that rolled back coverage for people with pre-existing conditions or eliminated ObamaCare’s “essential health benefits,” which dictate what services insurer must provide. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus specifically targeted that provision during negotiations over the House GOP's healthcare bill.“I’m opposed to the bill in its current form,” he said.After a half-hour of questions, Lance headed to a nearby classroom and spoke with reporters, including a handful from New York and Washington.Asked by a Hill reporter what he thinks of his colleagues avoiding town halls, Lance replied: “I learn a great deal at town hall meetings, and I do not choose to instruct other members what they should do.”“Presumably they know their districts,” he continued. “I know in this district that I have held town hall meetings and tonight was an example of that.”By showing up in Flanders, Lance sent a simple message: He may be vulnerable, but he’s not running away from his constituents. Or the press. Tags Rodney Frelinghuysen Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders Donald Trump lang: en_US inShare (function() )();",

      "text" : "Subscribe to The Atlantic’s Politics & Policy Daily, a roundup of ideas and events in American politics. From the moment Donald Trump first launched his unlikely ascent to the presidency, Republicans fiercely debated whether they could consider him a true conservative. Now, there’s evidence that Trump’s conquest of the GOP is causing activists to redefine “conservatism” itself.In a paper presented last week at a conference in Chicago, two political scientists compared Republican senators’ voting records to their perceived levels of conservatism among grassroots activists. (You can read a detailed description of the paper’s methodology here, but it’s worth noting that the surveys were conducted throughout the 2016 election.) What they found was that some of the senators with the most traditionally conservative voting records—like Arizona’s Jeff Flake, and Nebraska’s Ben Sasse—were viewed among activists as fairly moderate. Meanwhile, former Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions—whose record is considerably more moderate than many of his peers’—was viewed as one of the chamber’s most conservative lawmakers.The explanation for these discrepancies?The paper’s authors—Daniel Hopkins, from the University of Pennsylvania, and Hans Noel, from Georgetown— have a theory: Sasse and Flake were both outspoken Trump critics during the election, whereas Sessions was one of the president’s earliest and most vocal cheerleaders.Indeed, it appears many of the grassroots-level Republicans surveyed for the paper—the kind of people who make small-dollar donations to candidates, volunteer for phone banks, and staff local campaigns—believed that the more loyal a senator was to Trump, the more conservative he was. Needless to say, that’s a controversial assumption in elite right-wing circles, given Trump’s open disregard for conservative orthodoxy on issues like trade, foreign policy, and government spending.This could be an early signal that Trump-style nationalism is supplanting old-school conservatism as the Republican Party’s dominant ideology.As I wrote recently, many Republicans have found the traditional Left ↔ Right spectrum increasingly unhelpful in identifying the GOP’s ideological tensions during the Trump era. If activists do, in fact, begin to define “conservative” as “pro-Trump” and “moderate” as “Trump-averse,” it seems all the more likely that the old taxonomy will give way to a new, more useful vocabulary.But the paper’s findings could have political implications that extend far beyond diction, Noel told me. This could be an early signal that Trump-style nationalism is supplanting old-school conservatism as the Republican Party’s dominant ideology.“If Trump is shaping and changing the next generation of Republican foot soldiers to think of conservatism as what he thinks it is … instead of what Paul Ryan thinks it is, he’s going to lead the party in that direction,” Noel said.Exhibiting all the usual modesty of careful academics, Noel cautioned that it’s too early to drawn any definitive conclusions from their findings. He also noted that it typically takes a generation or so for a party to undergo a wide-scale ideological transformation like the one he was speculating about. And unlike modern conservatism—which William F. Buckley and his comrades spent decades articulating and popularizing before Ronald Reagan ever carried it into the White House—Trump’s brand of politics doesn’t yet have a robust support system or intellectual infrastructure in Washington. That said, Trumpism has an unusual head start compared to the historical rises of other ideologies—it’s already being championed by the most powerful man in the world. And as long as grassroots Republicans are demanding fealty to Trump from their elected leaders—lest they be branded “moderates” and made vulnerable to primary challenges—Trumpism has a good chance to flourish and spread throughout the GOP.Conservative purists, and perhaps many in the broader political intelligentsia, will no doubt object to conservatism being summarily redefined simply because voters and activists moved the goalposts. But Noel, who specializes in the study of ideology, takes a practical view of the philosophical debates on the right.“People argue about these things forever,” he told me. “There are deep debates among conservative thinkers, and whoever ends up convincing more people wins. You can say, ‘That’s not real conservatism,’ but … at the end of the day, you’re wrong if no one agrees with you.”Related Videos",

He expressed concerns about the Chinese government’s intervention in U.S. economy was hurting jobs for the American worker. Both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross spoke positively of a “100-day plan” that they discussed with their Chinese counterparts to make important changes immediately.\n“The most interesting thing to me was they expressed an interest in reducing their net trade balance because of the impact it’s having on money supply and inflation,” Ross said about the Chinese. “That’s the first time I’ve heard them say that in a bilateral context.”\nAccording to Xinhua, the Chinese state media, President Xi urged both countries to “grasp the opportunity” of economic development between the two countries and signaled interest in future investments. “China welcomes the U.S. side to participate in cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative,” said Xi.\nNorth Korea\nTrump and the Chinese agreed that North Korea’s nuclear weapons program presented a challenge to the region and said that they would take steps to pressure the rogue state with the “international community.”\nNo agreement was reached, but the United States reasserted that it is willing to act alone.\n“[W]e understand it creates unique problems for them and challenges and that we would, and are, prepared to chart our own course if this is something China is just unable to coordinate with us,” Tillerson said.\nSouth China Sea\nOfficials from the United States discussed the ongoing military buildup in the East and South China Seas, but the result was merely a “candid” conversation.\n“President Trump noted the importance of adhering to international rules and norms in the East and South China Seas and to previous statements on non-militarization,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement.\nHuman Rights\nTillerson remarked that America’s commitment to human rights was “quite clear” throughout all their discussions, but it appears that specific offenses were not discussed.\n“I don’t think you have to have a separate conversation, somehow separate our core values around human rights from our economic discussions, our military-to-military discussions, or our foreign policy discussions,” he said. “They’re really embedded in every discussion, that that is really what guides much of our view around how we’re going to work together.”\nSpicer said in a statement that Trump “noted the importance of protecting human rights and other values deeply held by Americans” during the visit.\nThe Chinese state media reported that Xi called on both sides to cooperate on issues such as “drug trafficking, child trafficking, money laundering, cyber crime and organized crime.”\nTrump to Visit China\nTrump accepted an invitation from President Xi to visit China for a state visit at some point.",

      "text" : "The Trump administration sought to block former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying to Congress in the House investigation of links between Russian officials and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, The Washington Post has learned, a position that is likely to further anger Democrats who have accused Republicans of trying to damage the inquiry. According to letters The Post reviewed, the Justice Department notified Yates earlier this month that the administration considers a great deal of her possible testimony to be barred from discussion in a congressional hearing because the topics are covered by the presidential communication privilege. [Read the letters on Sally Yates testifying before Congress] Yates and other former intelligence officials had been asked to testify before the House Intelligence Committee this week, a hearing that Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) abruptly canceled. Yates was the deputy attorney general in the final years of the Obama administration and served as the acting attorney general in the first days of the Trump administration. President Trump fired Yates in January after she ordered Justice Department lawyers not to defend his first immigration order temporarily banning entry to the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from around the world. Spicer says Post report on Yates is ‘false’ Embed Copy Share Play Video1:57 (Reuters) White House press secretary Sean Spicer on March 28 disputed a Washington Post report about efforts by the Trump administration to prevent former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying before Congress. White House press secretary Sean Spicer disputes a Washington Post report on former acting attorney general Sally Yates. (Reuters) As acting attorney general, Yates played a key part in the investigation surrounding Michael T. Flynn, a Trump campaign aide who became national security adviser before revelations that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States in late December led to his ouster. Yates and another witness at the planned hearing, former CIA director John Brennan, had made clear to government officials by Thursday that their testimony to the committee probably would contradict some statements that White House officials had made, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ken Wainstein, a lawyer for Brennan, declined to comment. On Friday, when Yates’s lawyer sent a letter to the White House indicating that she still wanted to testify, the hearing was canceled. During a briefing Tuesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer denied that the White House sought to hinder Yates’s testimony. “I hope she testifies, I look forward to it,’’ he said. “To suggest in any way, shape or form that we stood in the way of that is 100 percent false.’’ Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the panel was aware that Yates “sought permission to testify from the White House. Whether the White House’s desire to avoid a public claim of executive privilege to keep her from providing the full truth on what happened contributed to the decision to cancel today’s hearing, we do not know. But we would urge that the open hearing be rescheduled without delay and that Ms. Yates be permitted to testify freely and openly.’’ [Chairman and partisan: The dual roles of Devin Nunes raise questions about House investigation] In January, Yates warned White House counsel Donald McGahn that statements White House officials made about Flynn’s contact with the ambassador were incorrect, and could therefore expose the national security adviser to future blackmail by the Russians. In a March 23 letter to Acting Assistant Attorney General Samuel Ramer, Yates’s attorney David O’Neil described the government’s position, following a meeting he attended at the Justice Department on the issue. O’Neil, who declined to comment, noted in the letter that Yates is willing to testify, and that she will avoid discussing classified information and details that could compromise investigations. The correspondence was later shared with the Intelligence Committee. “The Department of Justice has advised that it believes there are further constraints on the testimony Ms. Yates may provide at the [Intelligence Committee] hearing. Generally, we understand that the department takes the position that all information Ms. Yates received or actions she took in her capacity as Deputy Attorney General and acting Attorney General are client confidences that she may not disclose absent written consent of the department,’’ the lawyer wrote. That letter indicates that government lawyers initially argued that Yates was bound by attorney-client confidentiality. “We believe that the department’s position in this regard is overbroad, incorrect, and inconsistent with the department’s historical approach to the congressional testimony of current and former officials,’’ the letter continues. “In particular, we believe that Ms. Yates should not be obligated to refuse to provide non-classified facts about the department’s notification to the White House of concerns about the conduct of a senior official. Requiring Ms. Yates to refuse to provide such information is particularly untenable given that multiple senior administration officials have publicly described the same events.’’ The following day, Scott Schools, a senior Justice Department lawyer, replied in a letter to O’Neil, saying the Yates conversations with the White House “are likely covered by the presidential communications privilege and possibly the deliberative process privilege. The president owns those privileges. Therefore, to the extent Ms. Yates needs consent to disclose the details of those communications to [the intelligence panel], she needs to consult with the White House. She need not obtain separate consent from the department.’’ That letter, in essence, marked Justice Department officials backing away from the dispute, saying that although they thought executive privilege probably applied to Yates’s discussions, that was a conversation she would have to have with lawyers at the White House, not the Justice Department. In response, O’Neil then sent a letter Friday to McGahn, the White House counsel, saying that any claim of privilege “has been waived as a result of the multiple public comments of current senior White House officials describing the January 2017 communications. Nevertheless, I am advising the White House of Ms. Yates’ intention to provide information.’’ He closed the letter by saying that if he did not hear back from the White House by 10 a.m. Monday, he would assume that the it “does not exert executive privilege over these matters with respect to the hearings or other settings.’’ The same day O’Neil sent that letter, Nunes, the Intelligence Committee’s chairman, said he would not go forward with the public hearing that was to feature Yates’ testimony, among others.

Guilty by proxy?: I work in a busy metropolitan area and often cross intersections against the light when there are no cars coming to save time, as I’m often traversing 12 or more blocks at a time across town. I’m very careful and know the traffic patterns of my routes well. However, last week, I was crossing the road after carefully checking that it was clear. A woman on the other side of the crosswalk looked right at me, saw that I was crossing the street (I was almost completely across by then), abruptly stepped into the road without looking and was struck by a car. I called 911 and waited with other bystanders until they came. I felt so horrible that I almost felt it would have been justified to press charges against me in the moment. The woman was clearly looking at me rather than the pedestrian light to determine if she could cross. I believe everyone is responsible for their personal safety in matters such as crossing the road, which is why I am willing to take the personal risk of crossing against the light, but now I feel I jeopardized someone else’s safety without meaning to. What can I do to assuage my guilt? I feel so awful I’ve been having trouble sleeping and feel traumatized. A: Your traumatized response is completely understandable, although I’m glad to hear you’re aware, at least intellectually, that you were not responsible for this woman’s accident. Bear in mind that you did the right thing in the moment by calling 911 and staying with this woman until help arrived, and that it’s every individual’s responsibility to check for cars before crossing the street. What you witnessed was shocking, sudden, and violent; if you’re having trouble sleeping and find yourself jumpy and hyper-alert throughout the day, you might find PTSD therapy helpful. If you’d like to do something more active to alleviate your guilt, consider supporting an organization that promotes pedestrian safety in your city. In the meantime, if you find your daily commute increasingly stressful, consider only crossing with the light. Even if that adds a few minutes to your travel time, it may go a long way toward easing your mind. Subscribe to Prudie! Q. Sleepovers: My son and his friends are all 9 years old. A couple of weeks ago he had a friend that was over at our house until pretty late on a Friday night, the boys were pretty into the game they were playing, so I asked “Ryan” if he’d like to stay the night. He said sure, and I contacted his parents to see if that would be OK. It wasn’t, and I understood since it was on very short notice. Then this past week my son and Ryan wanted to plan a sleepover. Ryan was again unable to spend the night, and later his mother texted me saying “It isn’t you, he’s just not allowed to do any sleepovers since things go wrong and people make bad decisions.” Ignoring that I think it’s weird and that there’s nothing that can happen at night to someone that can’t also happen during the day, my question is this: We will soon be finishing our basement, and my son would like to have a couple of friends over to go to a movie and then have a sleepover as a “celebration” that the basement is done. Do we invite Ryan again, knowing that his parents will say no? I’m conflicted, and can see it as Ryan feeling left out if he wasn’t invited, even knowing he can’t come; but then I don’t want to fuel any hard feelings between Ryan and his parents or make his parents think “We’ve already told this woman no? Doesn’t she understand the meaning of the word?” A: What an odd and vague rule! “Ryan can’t spend the night ... Things go wrong. People make bad decisions” sounds like a tag line to a very strange apocalyptic children’s movie. But if you’re aware that your son’s friend isn’t allowed to attend sleepovers as a general rule, weird or not, you should respect it, and leave it at that. Feel free to tell Ryan’s parents that he’s always welcome at your house for an overnight visit if they ever change their mind as he gets older, but don’t keep asking about individual exceptions. Advertisement Q. Dad wants to spend money to get me married!: Neither me nor my father is an Orthodox Jew, both of us being pretty happy at our small Conservative synagogue. Recently though, Dad has taken to attending the Chabad synagogue (think very Orthodox Jews: Old men who sit separately from the women, and very traditional). As it turns out, he claims he did this because the Chabad has a woman who is a matchmaker, and he informed me that he’s planning to spend about $700 to have her introduce me to a woman around my age with the intent of quickly getting married. I don’t know where this came from, or why he blindsided me with it. I’m not sure if I do or don’t want this. My research into arranged marriages has been heartwarming at best, and horrific at worst. I get that he wants me to be happy and thinks that this is the way to happiness, and I don’t disagree, but I can’t fathom having him spend that much on something I’m not completely certain about. Is there a way to gently talk him out of this endeavor? A: Dismiss gentleness as a method entirely! This is not a situation that calls for gentleness; if you’re “not sure” that you want to enter into an arranged marriage, err on the side of not binding yourself permanently to a woman you’re not sure about. There are plenty of ways to meet marriage-minded women, if you think marriage (to someone you have more than a nodding acquaintance with) is something you want, that don’t involve your father’s direct involvement or spending hundreds of dollars on a matchmaker. Tell him straight out that you’re not sure why he made this decision without consulting you, but that he shouldn’t waste his money by hiring a matchmaker on your behalf. Tell him you don’t want to hurt whatever women she might have in mind, who may genuinely be interested in an arranged marriage, since you’re neither certain nor prepared to enter into such an arrangement. You seem sure that your father genuinely means well, so feel free to thank him for his interest and concern, but let him know that he does not need to make major decisions about your future on your behalf. Q. Re: Sleepovers: The easiest solution is just to invite “Ryan” over for the first part of the evening and then his parents agree to pick him up by a certain time. Explain to them in advance that the other boys will be staying over, and Ryan is welcome if they are comfortable with that, but if not, you’ll be back from the movies by whatever time and they can pick him up then. Easy-peasy. A: That’s a lovely compromise that allows Ryan to still feel included without trying to get his parents to change their rule. Thanks!

Q. Ready to start a family at 29: I have a lovely, good boyfriend who I’ve been with for three years. He is four years younger than me and just starting out in his new career that he’s been working hard to get going. It’s going to be a bit of a road for him to work his way up to a comfortable wage, and his work takes him out of town a lot. The problem is that for the past year I have been struggling with deep, bizarre-to-me urges to have children. We’ve discussed and planned a life together, but in his eyes the marriage and kid part doesn’t start for a couple more years at least. I don’t know what to do. I love him so much, but I am afraid of missing a chance to have a family, which I so deeply desire right now. I would be OK with starting in a couple years, if I could be guaranteed that my baby-making parts will all be in good shape (all this drama around fertility declining after 30 makes me really anxious). Help me work through this. A: If you’re anxious about your ability to have biological children in a few years, go to the doctor and get your fertility tested, so that you have sufficient information to make long-term plans, like freezing your eggs. If you learn that you’re in excellent reproductive health and your boyfriend cheerily anticipates being ready for parenthood three or four years down the line, so much the better (although it’s worth bearing in mind that it’s always possible he could get hit by a bus or change his mind; nothing is guaranteed). If you learn that having biological children may require medical intervention or likely prove difficult-to-impossible for you, then you and your boyfriend will have to have a separate set of conversations. Consider what would be the absolute worst-case scenario for you. Would it be never having biological children at all? Spending thousands of dollars and countless hours on fertility treatments if they did not prove successful? Would you be willing to consider raising children as a single parent, or would you only want to have children with a partner? Whatever the answer to these questions are, you don’t have to sit around wondering about the status of your reproductive health—you can find out right now. Advertisement Q. Friends and age: Recently my daughter was telling me her new friend Sue’s mother doesn’t let Sue hang out with friends two years older than her for sleepovers, meetups, etc. Even when chaperoned with a parent. In my opinion this is slightly odd. My daughter doesn’t have friends with a huge age gap, but two years doesn’t seem like a big deal. Both girls are young teenagers. Is this a common rule other parents have? A: I have no idea if this is a common rule for parents, but whether it’s ordinary as houses or the only rule of its kind in the world doesn’t really matter. Your own daughter, fortunately, falls within the two-year cutoff, so it doesn’t affect you. Feel free to institute as many (or as few) age-related friendship rules as you like on your own daughter, and leave it at that. If you want to privately consider Sue’s parents a little overbearing, go right ahead; one of the great joys of parenting is privately considering all other parents of one’s acquaintance to be out of their gourds. But this is not a situation that requires outside intervention. Q. Undecided girlfriend: My boyfriend and I enjoy different things to the extent that the way we like to spend our weekends, holidays, and even evenings is very different. We have loved each other very much, have a lot in common, and get along in many ways, but whenever I think of a life of accommodating (especially to his love of overdrinking to the point of not being able to talk properly), I get irritated, feel out of love, and even look down on him. I’m not ready to leave my best friend and lover, but I keep wanting to—how can I make up my mind? A: You get to spend as much time as you like feeling irritated, out of love, and contemptuous toward your boyfriend as you need before you leave. Or, if you’re not especially good at hiding feelings of irritation and contempt, he may decide to leave you once he realizes every time you start thinking about a future together, you roll your eyes and head for the nearest exit. It’s simply a question of how much time you’re interested in spending kicking this can down the road. Advertisement Ask yourself why you’re not ready to leave your boyfriend. You say he’s your “best friend,” but surely you don’t normally feel irritated, stone-hearted, and scornful about your other friends when you contemplate the future of your relationship together. Are you worried about what it might feel like to be single? Reluctant to leave someone you know you can always rely upon for affection and comfort, even if you no longer care for them? Scared of the unknown? Feel like ending your relationship now will somehow invalidate the relationship you two once had years ago? Whatever you’re afraid to face, it’s likely that staying in this relationship you know isn’t going anywhere is protecting you from it. Take another look at the letter you just wrote. You described a relationship where you and your boyfriend have such wildly differing desires that, if you two were to design an ideal monthly, weekly, or even daily calendar, it wouldn’t be able to include the both of you. You claim to have “a lot in common,” but can’t see yourself spending an evening together and both enjoying it. You mention that he loves to drink himself into a stupor, and envision your future with him with disgust and aversion. You say that you “keep wanting” to leave him. I’m not sure what else you need to make up your mind, but you just might find the reason in your own words, if you’re willing to take a second look. Q. Gaslighting?: For 20-plus years I have struggled with depression. In that time I’ve been hospitalized twice and gone through multiple types of treatments. I am also on a number of medications, probably for life. That said, I’m afraid I’m being gaslighted. I have frequently been “corrected” on my memories, even on ones that seem so clear and certain to me. Is it reasonable for me to fear something is happening here? Or should I accept that my memories may often be wrong due to my mental health issues? A: This is a difficult question to answer, especially since I don’t have many details about your treatment plan or the symptoms you’ve experienced, but I think I can offer you a few guiding principles that may prove helpful. If the “corrections” you receive are coming from multiple sources, and they generally agree with one another, then it’s unlikely you are being intentionally manipulated. It’s possible that someone else’s recollection of past events may simply differ from your own. This does not necessarily mean the other party maliciously intends to deceive you, or cause you to doubt your own recollection; “gaslighting” only comes into play if you suspect someone of deliberately sabotaging your health and independence. If a friend or family member remembers a certain time in your past as dark and painful, for example, while you consider it to have been unremarkable, that doesn’t mean they’re trying to gaslight you—they simply had a different experience of your behavior than you did. That doesn’t mean, of course, that you must always miscount your own memory when it doesn’t line up with someone else’s; you are not automatically “wrong” because you suffer from depression or take medication. If, however, you generally trust the people in your life, and believe they have your best interests at heart, it’s likely that you can also trust that they are not trying to gaslight you, and that you can sometimes disagree or remember events differently for perfectly benign reasons. Advertisement Q. My doctor is a Chatty Cathy: After a few visits to the new doctor, I’ve noticed a pattern. He loves to talk about himself. It’s never inappropriate, but he mentions his paperwork, his commute, daily chatter, and what he eats, and spends lots of time talking about his stuff during the visit. His care is great once I ask questions. I despise talking about myself and like to listen, so I don’t think this is a problem. But I’ve never run across a doctor who talks this much. Is it OK to just listen as long as I’m getting the care I need? It’s a medical doctor, not a therapist, so I’m not paying him to listen to me talk the whole time.

You have a chatty doctor, but he’s neither inappropriately intimate nor discussing topics you find offensive, and he pays careful attention to you when the topic turns to your health. As long as his digressions don’t bother you or distract him from the task at hand, allow yourself to drift merrily along the surface of his meaningless sea of chatter.

A few years ago, I made a good friend at work. We could talk to each other about everything. Our kids got on really well too, which was an added bonus. There was just one issue: My husband hated her from the get-go. At first he gave shallow reasons like she’s too tall or she just looks untrustworthy. Later, if we ever got in an argument, he’d jump at the chance to put her down more. Eventually he forbade me from seeing her unless our kids were present. I still would hang out with her alone as adults here and there; I’d just not tell him. I never told her my husband did not want me seeing her. Eventually, she found out and was furious. The next day, my husband looked her email up on the school contact list and sent a hate-filled email to her. He never told me and acted completely normal. She forwarded it to me and said we couldn’t be friends or even speak anymore. I apologized to her, acknowledging I put her in a terrible situation, but to no avail. I get it, she shouldn’t have to deal with that. I was devastated, work is completely awkward and miserable, I really miss my friend, and my daughter misses her friends. My husband feels victorious and has been extra nice lately. I’m having a difficult time feeling OK around my husband. I confronted him about the email, but he responded that he probably went a little too far but was not sorry for doing it because he got me back. This is somewhat creepy to me. I see a therapist, but he refuses to go, saying they are all against him and our marriage. How is it possible to rebuild trust and a healthy relationship where there has been so much dysfunction and mistrust for so long? A: You can’t rebuild trust with someone against his will, and your husband has demonstrated no interest in behaving in a trustworthy matter. You say it’s hard for you to make good friends that last, and I’m worried this is not the first time your husband has gone out of his way to keep you from developing relationships with anyone who isn’t him. Your husband is controlling, creepy, abusive, and cruel. He didn’t go a “little too far”—he tried to keep you, an adult woman, from having friends, sent abusive messages to your friend at her work email, and refused to apologize for doing so. In fact he congratulates himself on “getting you back,” as if your having friends was somehow a threat to your marriage. It is not only not possible, it is not desirable to rebuild a relationship with this man. You and your children are better off without him. Subscribe to Prudie! Q. Emotions surrounding prenup: My fiancé is significantly wealthier than me and has asked that we draw up a prenuptial agreement to protect his existing assets in case of a divorce. He has been very clear that anything we earn or acquire during our marriage would be distributed equally, which is obviously better for me than for him. I understand why he wants this, and if I were in his position, I could see wanting the same thing. However, every time we talk about it, I get very emotional, because having to plan for the hypothetical end of our relationship is sad, right?! He doesn’t understand this and is very anxious that I am going to be weepy at the attorney’s office when we meet with her. He also comes from a divorced family and is once divorced himself, whereas no one in my family has ever divorced, and this is my first serious relationship. Big difference in perspective there. Am I unreasonable for having these feelings? A: Not at all! This sounds like a reasonable agreement, and it’s perfectly normal to find the idea of a prenup both reasonable and overwhelming. You’re not trying to back out of anything; you’re just experiencing pretty understandable pangs of sadness and fear as you discuss the possible end of your marriage before you begin it. (Also, if you get a little weepy in his lawyer’s office—so what? She’s a professional; she’s not going to melt under the weight of a few tears.) Since you two are spending a lot of time carefully considering your finances before your wedding, consider spending some additional time carefully examining your emotional connection in premarital counseling. That’s not to say you should demand premarital counseling as your version of a prenup, simply that you two are about to take a huge step together and seem to have fairly different ideas about how to talk about difficult emotions. Consider both the prenuptial agreement and the counseling to be investments in the long-term health of your marriage, and good luck. Advertisement Q. A nurse, who is male: I am a nurse who is male. Not a male nurse (that term is considered offensive). I have been married for over a year. When we were dating I got the feeling my now wife wasn’t too thrilled with my job choice. She teased me about it, saying things like how I must really have wanted to be a doctor but didn’t have the brains. I talked to her about it. I told her that I never wanted to be “more than” a nurse, and to be able to take care of people had been my dream for years. Medicine is too hands-off for me, and I never even thought of that route. She apologized and said she understood, and the comments stopped. She even seemed to appreciate what I did. Now that we are married the comments are starting again. Last night she was on her laptop and called me over. She pointed out an APN program at a local college and said, “If you can’t be a doctor, you can at least be better than an RN.” I told her that I had no interest in an advanced degree. APNs take on a physician’s role, which is not what I want, or work in administration, which is also not what I want. All I want is to be a bedside nurse, taking care of people to the best of my ability. A: Your wife is really gunning for this year’s “Most Unequivocally Awful Thing a Spouse Has Said in Dear Prudence” award. To suggest that nurses are just failed doctors is dismissive, thoughtless, totally out of touch with reality, and in your wife’s case, sexist as hell. (Also, I’d love to know what her job is that allows her to dismiss RNs! Is she Jacques Bérès or one of the other founders of Doctors Without Borders?* Because if not, that’s a little hypocritical—and actually, I’d imagine the founders of Doctors Without Borders have a healthy appreciation for nurses.) Let’s hope that in every other aspect of married life she’s a gem and a delight. Regardless, these comments display a lack of respect for you, your choices, and the work you do every day, and you don’t have to put up with them. Tell her, “I’ve been a nurse since before I knew you. My job never came as a surprise to you. I’ve told you I find it personally fulfilling, well-suited to my abilities, and allows me to take care of other people in a way that makes me profoundly satisfied. I’m really sorry that that bothers you, because you’re missing out on a significant opportunity to be happy for your partner. You might think nursing isn’t a ‘good enough’ career for me, but I love it and have no desire to become a doctor, an APN, or anything else. I’d like you to drop the subject, and try to be happy for me.” Q. Re: Emotions surrounding prenup: The feelings are not unreasonable, but I also don’t think the fiancé is unreasonable for wanting to have a prenup if he has previous negative experiences with divorce. The best course is to hire your own attorney to help you negotiate the process, negotiate with the spouse, and protect any assets that YOU bring to the table. Advertisement Also, this is an excellent opportunity to ensure that already existing children (both his and yours, if applicable) are protected in the event of a divorce. It’s also an excellent opportunity to ensure that everything else is in order, including your wills, your advanced medical directives, and your powers of attorney. A: Yes! That’s such a good point, and one I didn’t think of at all—OP, you should have your own lawyer to review the documents and advise you. That’s not antagonistic; that’s just good prenuptial sense. Q. I walk the line: My husband of one year has a bit of a hangup about one of my male friends, whom I met three years before my husband. Somewhere in those three years, I had a long, unrequited crush (he is gay) on this male friend, but that crush died off soon before I met my husband—a husband whom I adore and is a much better match for me than this friend ever would have been even if he were straight. This friend and I naturally drifted apart some, but I still talk to him once in a while on Facebook or Twitter, usually in public but occasionally through chat. We have known each other a long time and care about each other’s lives. The things we talk about are sometimes personal but completely innocent and not overly intimate. We will talk about, say, the fact that he is considering joining another religion. My husband and I have had many talks about his jealousy about my former feelings toward my friend. He knows that nothing is going on, that my friend is gay, that I am not pining after him, and that I have a right to my former friendships, but I know he still feels insecure. So when my husband sees me typing away on my phone and casually asks who I’m talking to, if it’s this friend, I usually tell him it’s one of my other friends (even other male ones) just to avoid an argument or making my husband feel bad. Is this wrong? I feel like I’m acting like a cheater but I just want to avoid a fight about something I don’t really think is my problem. A: You say you’re lying about who you’re talking to in order to avoid a fight, but you don’t say that your husband makes a habit of fighting with you about your interactions with this particular friend, just that he feels insecure, which makes me wonder if what you’re actually trying to avoid is being honest and vulnerable with your husband. If he actually gives you a hard time when you’re texting your friend, that’s one thing, but if you’re just trying to pretend your friend doesn’t exist, I think that’s a suboptimal strategy. Based on what you’ve written here, it sounds like your husband has behaved fairly well—he’s aware that there’s nothing going on between you and your friend and that his own insecurities should not dictate your behavior. Advertisement You’re not obligated to update your husband every time you text someone, of course, and if you think he’s asking in part because he wants to needle you about the friend you used to have a crush on in particular, I can understand your policy of general avoidance. But if he’s doing a reasonably good job of trying to manage his own insecurities, I think you should take a step toward increased intimacy and be honest about who you’re talking to when the subject comes up. Q. Re: Friends vs. spouse: My question is how her therapist isn’t helping her understand that she is being emotionally abused. She also needs to get a new therapist. A: Absolutely. Part of the value of a therapist is having a neutral third party who can help you recognize patterns that you’re too close to see. We don’t know what the therapist has to say about the situation (or even that the OP has given said therapist all the details she’s given us), but if your therapist knows what your husband has done and isn’t putting the dots together—if your therapist isn’t helping you identify your husband’s controlling, isolating behavior as part of a pattern of emotional abuse—then you need a new therapist, pronto. Q. Different parenting styles: I have a wonderful and darling friend who happens to fall on the side of (what I consider to be) fussy and overly indulgent helicopter parenting, where I tend to the free-range-with-a-vengeance and zero-censorship side. I come from a large, involved family (I have more than 50 first cousins, and I’ve babysat most of them!) and I’ve also fostered kids at different times in my life, whereas she comes from a very small family—just one sibling and both her parents are deceased. I will admit to having a little bit of arrogance where kids are concerned—if a kid does it, I’ve probably dealt with it. Which by no means makes me perfect or infallible! It seems to me she’s her own worst enemy where her son is concerned. He’s 4, and she complains that he’s a terrible sleeper—but she’s spent the last four years indulging a bedtime routine that makes circus acts look quiet. Projector-style mobiles, starlight walks, rocking, swaddling, car rides, time-outs, and existential discussions about the biological functions of sleep, often until midnight or later. Bedtime and sleep hygiene are the worst area, but this parenting style stretches across every aspect of her life. She’s been my best friend for 15 years, but I’m finding it increasingly difficult not to be judgmental and tell her off every time she complains that Baby kept her up again last night. My own kids are grown or nearly so (17 and 20), and all I can see is years of behavioral problems that she’s manufacturing with her own behavior. Remind me how to separate myself from her issues without losing a friend I really do love dearly? Advertisement A: Friend, with withered hopes: “Last night my swaddled son kept me awake for a thousand years. I have no heart or lungs left in my chest, only a profound desire to become a small rock that lives quietly by the sea.” You, winsome and charming and wearing a becoming hat: “I’m so sorry to hear that! I’ve had a lot of luck with certain techniques with my kids—I’m sure you’ve done plenty of research already, but if you’d ever like to hear about what’s worked for me, I’d be happy to share.” If she bites, great; if she doesn’t, she doesn’t. When she complains again in future, remember that you don’t have to fix her problem or feel any of the consequences for her—just stick with “I’m so sorry to hear that,” and “That sounds awful,” and the many polite, standard-issue variations thereof. The one issue that’s worth bringing up with her without asking her first is the time-outs—if she’s disciplining her kid, however mildly, for failing to fall asleep (which is hardly something a 4-year-old can control), then I think that merits your saying something directly to her, whether she invites your feedback or not. You can’t punish a child into falling asleep.

Join In Advertisement Q. My yard is full of dog poop—but I don’t have a dog: We recently moved into a house in a suburb that feels like a small town. We like the house, but I’m still not sure about leaving the city. My children love our front yard, and we play out there nearly every day. My children are young, 4 and 1 years old, and the back yard is a hill that is difficult to negotiate for my littlest. So if we are playing outside, it has to be in the front yard. The problem is I (or my children) find dog crap in my yard all the time. We don’t have pets, but as far as I can tell, almost everyone else on our street does. I’ve seen at least four different dogs in my yard at various times as well as a few cats. I’m not monitoring my yard constantly or interested in starting that but I don’t want other people’s pets using my yard as a toilet. It’s not just a pain to clean up, but it is unsanitary, and my kids are still at the stage where they have to touch everything. Each time I’m scooping up poop or washing it off a child’s shoe, I fantasize about visiting my neighbors one by one and yelling at them to come pick up after their dogs. I don’t really want to do that because I’d like to have a friendly relationship with my neighbors. But what do I do? Is it normal to just let your dog roam around and leave waste wherever it wants, or did I pick the wrong street to buy a house on? A: You can get one of those “Pick up after your dog” signs for your lawn, which might help, but given that there’s always a degree of uncertainty when it comes to the provenance of dog poop, I don’t think yelling at your neighbors individually will be an effective strategy. You could also get a fence! Even a small one would discourage wanderers. Mallory Ortberg: Until next week—may all your therapists be circumspect and your dogs well-trained.

      "text" : "The culinary battle between butter and margarine has raged for decades, but, it turns out, for the wrong reason. We now know that the partly hydrogenated fatty acids in margarine and many processed foods are harmful to health — more harmful, in fact, than the saturated fat in butter.This does not mean butter is healthier. But it does mean consumers need to pay far more attention to the fat content of all the foods they consume, both at home and in restaurants. The process commonly used to convert liquid vegetable oil into a fat with the consistency of butter, the baking qualities of lard and a long shelf life forms trans fatty acids, which every diner and snacker should avoid.Gram for gram, trans fats, as they are commonly called, are more hazardous to the heart than the saturated fats that damage arteries. Like saturated fats, they raise the “bad,” or L.D.L., cholesterol that can become glued to arteries; but unlike saturated fats, they also lower the “good” H.D.L. cholesterol that clears away these harmful deposits.Butter is not a heart-healthy choice because its saturated fat far outweighs the trans fat in traditional stick margarines. Also, butter contains cholesterol, which can raise blood levels of cholesterol in some people; margarine, which is made from vegetable sources, does not.The good news is that a Food and Drug Administration ruling, which took effect in January, requires food companies to list the amount of trans fats on the nutrition label of every package. As a result, most companies have switched the fats they use so they can say “no trans fats” on the label.The bad news is that some substitutions — to tropical oils like palm, palm kernel and coconut — are reintroducing more heart-damaging saturated fats to American diets and causing environmental devastation in several countries where palm and coconut trees grow.Furthermore, consumers who use the “no trans fats” label proclamation as their buying guide can still end up buying a lot of what nutritionists call junk foods. And the F.D.A. ruling does not apply to foods sold in restaurants, bakeries, takeout and other retail food outlets where unsuspecting consumers could be loading up on harmful trans fats.That prompted the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in March to ask the city’s 20,000 restaurants and 14,000 food suppliers to eliminate partly hydrogenated oils from kitchens and provide foods and food products free of industrially produced trans fatty acids.What Trans Fats DoThe health concerns about trans fats go far beyond the effects on blood cholesterol. In a report in the June issue of The Journal of the American Dietetic Association, researchers led by Katherine M. Phillips, a biochemist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, reviewed what is known about trans fats and their alternatives.The “trans” in trans fatty acids refers to the biochemical configuration of the fat molecule. Natural polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils have a “cis” conformation: the hydrogen atoms in each double bond are on the same side. But the processes used in partial hydrogenation results in some double bonds with a “trans” conformation: hydrogen atoms on opposite sides of each double bond.This little biochemical switch turns out to have potentially devastating health effects. In addition to raising bad cholesterol (especially the small L.D.L. particles that stick to blood vessels) and lowering good cholesterol, trans fatty acids raise blood levels of triglycerides and lipoprotein (a), which raise cardiovascular risk.But that is not all. Trans fatty acids, when compared with cis-unsaturated fats, also raise blood levels of substances like C-reactive protein that are markers of bodywide inflammation and cellular dysfunction, also linked to heart and blood vessel disease.Trans fats can interfere with the metabolism of essential fatty acids, the synthesis of healthful omega-3 fatty acids and the balance of prostaglandins, disrupting protection against blood clots. And high intakes of trans fats may cause insulin resistance, a marker of type 2 diabetes.In a recent review in The New England Journal of Medicine on the relationship between trans fats and heart disease, even low levels of trans fats in the diet — a mere 1 percent to 2 percent of calories per day — were linked to a substantially increased risk of heart disease. In studies of 140,000 individuals, consuming 2 percent of calories as trans fats resulted in a 23 percent increase in heart disease.In 1983, scientists at the United States Department of Agriculture estimated that the average American consumed 8 grams of trans fats a day (that’s 3.6 percent of a 2,000-calorie diet), with 85 percent coming from foods containing partly hydrogenated oils and the rest from trans fats naturally present in meat and dairy products.The low levels of trans fats in meats and dairy products result from hydrogenation by microbes in the gut of ruminant animals (cows, sheep and goats). In addition, small amounts of trans fats are formed when vegetable oils are refined at high temperatures.A more recent estimate based on mid-1990’s data by the F.D.A. put the average trans fat consumption by adults at 5.8 grams a day. The main contributors of these fats were cakes and related products (23.8 percent), margarine (16.5 percent), cookies and crackers (9.8 percent), fried potatoes (8.3 percent), chips and snacks (4.8 percent) and household shortenings (4.3 percent).Choosing Healthier FoodsThe new food label rule exempts products with less than 0.5 gram of trans fatty acid per serving, which can list the amount as zero per serving. But if someone eats, say, four servings of the food instead of one, as many do, the amount of trans fats consumed can have a significant effect.The only way to know if a zero listing really means zero is to check the ingredients list. If partly hydrogenated oil is an ingredient, there is some trans fat in the food. (Fully hydrogenated oils, listed only as “hydrogenated,” do not contain trans fats. Rather, these fats are saturated.)Furthermore, the listing of trans fats is meaningful only if consumers read the label and select foods that have no trans fats and no partly hydrogenated oils.If you want to avoid trans fats when eating out or buying takeout, you have to ask how a food was prepared. Ask what cooking fats were used, including the oils in salad dressings. The New England Journal authors said that to avoid adverse health effects, “complete or near-complete avoidance of industrially produced trans fats” is necessary.To protect heart health, you would be wise, as well, to avoid foods made with tropical oils (palm, palm kernel and coconut), which contain saturated fatty acids.Soft and liquid margarines have little or no trans fats. And American producers are working hard to develop alternative methods of producing shelf-stable vegetable oils, which should be on the shelf in the next year or so.McDonald’s in Denmark, where there is a legal limit on industrially produced trans fats in foods (less than 2 percent), manages to serve food without these harmful fats. Why not here? Denmark has shown that eliminating partly hydrogenated vegetable oils from foods in stores and restaurants does not result in a loss of palatability, availability or quality, or an increase in the cost or consumption of saturated fats.",

Whole Foods became a Fortune 500 company, and Mr. Mackey, a wealthy, foodie celebrity.Now competition has caught up to Whole Foods, and Mr. Mackey is being forced to try conventional grocery-store pricing and other supermarket tactics to reverse his company’s flagging fortunes.The pressure ratcheted up with the disclosure in a securities filing Monday that activist investor Jana Partners LLC and several allies had amassed an 8.8% stake in Whole Foods and want the company to accelerate its overhaul and explore a possible sale. Jana said in its filing it wants Whole Foods to more quickly adopt standard grocery-industry practices it long had eschewed: loyalty cards that would allow it to target shoppers with coupons based on their buying habits; centralizing product purchasing to improve efficiency; and advertising sales and discounts.“We are confident in the actions we are taking to position the company for continued success,” Mr. Mackey said in a written statement Tuesday, “and we remain open to ideas to create further value for our shareholders and all our stakeholders.”Whole Foods owned the natural and organic market for years, so Mr. Mackey was able to charge premium prices and didn’t need much promotion.“When you average 8% same-store sales [growth] for 35 years, it can breed a sense of, ‘Why do we need to change? Things are working,’” Mr. Mackey said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal.Other grocers, however, got into the organics game at lower prices. Over the last 18 months, Whole Foods, which now counts 462 stores, notched its longest stretch of quarterly same-store sales declines since going public in 1992. It is down as many as 14 million customer visits over the past six quarters, according to Barclays PLC. Its shares have lost nearly half their value since peaking in 2013.Health-Food ProblemAs Whole Foods’ sales have slowed, profit has declined.ProfitSales$600 million$20 billion3001000’10’12’06’14’16’06’08’14’12’10’16’08Source: the companyTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL.Health-Food ProblemAs Whole Foods’ sales have slowed, profit has declined.ProfitSales$20 billion$600 million1030000’12’10’08’06’16’14’12’10’08’06’16’14Source: the companyTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL.Health-Food ProblemAs Whole Foods’ sales have slowed, profit has declined.ProfitSales$20 billion$600 million3001000’13’11’09’07’16’14’12’10’08’06’06’08’13’10’12’11’09’07’16’14’15’15Source: the companyTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL.Health-Food ProblemAs Whole Foods’ sales have slowed, profit has declined.SalesProfit$600 million$20 billion1030000’12’12’10’10’08’06’16’06’14’08’14’16Source: the companyTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL.Today, warehouse-club retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. says it sells more organic food than any other retailer. In its last fiscal year, Kroger Co. , the nation’s largest conventional supermarket chain, reported natural and organic sales that surpassed all of Whole Foods’ revenue for the year.“More conventional supermarkets are copying us,” says Mr. Mackey. “Every place we went bred the Midas touch. But it also bred envy.”The U.S. grocery industry as a whole is mired in one of the most challenging financial stretches in decades. With more places to shop for food, consumers feel less loyal to their local stores. Amazon.com has gotten into the grocery business, and European deep-discount food retailers Lidl Stiftung & Co. and Aldi Sued are expected to expand in the U.S. this year.The longest slump since 1950 in the price of food commodities such as eggs, meat and dairy has sparked a price war, eating into grocers’ razor-thin margins. Operating profits for grocery stores declined by about 5% last year, according to Moody’s Investors Service . Stocks of food retailers are down 6.3% this year. Whole Foods’ shares, which rose 10% on Monday when Jana disclosed its stake, are now up 9% this year.Mr. Mackey, a strict vegan who favors jeans, fleece jackets and athletic shoes, started in the business when he was only 25. He scraped together $45,000 to open Safer Way Natural Foods in a Victorian home in Austin, Texas, in 1978, after drifting in and out of college for six years without graduating. He lived in a house with a vegetarian co-op. A friend from that time recalled nothing but tofu in his refrigerator.In 1980, in partnership with two other local health-food-store owners, he opened the first Whole Foods Market in Austin. The store was large for its time, and the company expanded quickly. During the 1990s and 2000s, it acquired 11 regional health-food chains.“He was so much more financially sophisticated than everyone in our world,” says Doug Greene, founder of New Hope Natural Media, which hosts natural-products trade shows. “John was talking about investment bankers and share prices when we were all talking about, ‘Gee, do you think we can get a small business loan?’”Mr. Mackey allowed his company’s 11 different regions to act nearly independently, fueling local creativity.“He said, ‘We can’t figure out Florida. You will run Florida for us and show us how to do it,’” recalls Richie Gerber, who sold his Bread of Life Natural Foods Markets chain to Whole Foods in 1997.In 2010, Mr. Mackey began sharing the CEO role with Walter Robb. Their chain earned a cachet that health food hadn’t had before. It became known for healthier eating and unique, upscale ingredients. It sold organic chia seeds in one aisle, and in another, smoked chicken sausage on toast paired with wine chosen by a master sommelier. Last year, Whole Foods’ prepared foods and bakery sales hit $3 billion.“It still is the default if you want to go to a supermarket and think what you find will be good,” says food writer Mark Bittman, whom Jana has retained as a consultant as part of its investment initiative.Mr. Mackey instituted animal-welfare standards and maintained a strict and lengthy list of ingredients he won’t allow in his stores, such as the Red 40 food dye and the artificial sweetener aspartame.As the company opened new stores and acquired other retailers, annual sales grew sixfold between 1995 to 2005, then more than tripled over the next decade, corporate filings indicate. Mr. Mackey bought homes in Austin and Boulder and took friends on an all-vegan catamaran trip in the Caribbean. In 2007, saying he no longer felt the need to work for money, he voluntarily began drawing a $1 annual salary. As of December, he held 980,000 shares of company stock, worth about $33 million. He routinely flies coach.His political opinions have drawn social-media criticism from some customers. He is against government health-insurance mandates and he believes society will be able to manage climate change.In 2007, when Whole Foods was trying to acquire Wild Oats Markets Inc., federal regulators revealed that Mr. Mackey had written hundreds of anonymous posts on Yahoo Finance message boards championing his own company’s stock and criticizing rival Wild Oats Markets. Regulators cited the posts as proof that Wild Oats was a top competitor and a merger would violate antitrust laws. (The Securities and Exchange Commission found no wrongdoing.) Mr. Mackey apologized for the posts and Whole Foods completed the acquisition in 2009 after agreeing to sell some Wild Oats assets.In 2015, its image with customers took a hit when the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs accused it of overcharging customers in nine stores by putting incorrect weights on some items.A far bigger problem, however, was that conventional grocers had begun carrying specialty products that once were exclusive to Whole Foods—at cheaper prices—and offering their own high-end salad bars and beer halls. At the same time, specialty grocers such as Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. and Trader Joe’s expanded and siphoned off customers. Certain health-food makers began stocking their products in other stores. “We take opportunities as they come, and right now, those opportunities seem to be more at the conventional stores,” says Matt Oscamou, founder of Frontier Snacks, Inc. Frontier is taking his latest granola to supermarkets such as Kroger instead of Whole Foods because they are offering better shelf space.As its sales softened, Whole Foods began lowering prices. In September 2015, it announced it would cut 1,500 workers. Still, in the fiscal year ending last September, its profit declined by more than 5% and its comparable-store sales—a key retailer metric—fell 2.5%.“They failed to recognize that as the category matures, price becomes more important,” says UBS analyst Michael Lasser. Customers jokingly called the store “Whole Paycheck.” Pricing had been the subject of tense debate among senior managers for years, according to people familiar with their thinking. Steps to lower prices and offer discounts have eaten into profit margins, but Whole Foods is still more expensive than its largest competitors, analysts say.“I would shop here for everything except for the price,” said Cathy Price, a 45-year-old mother of two, during a recent visit to a Chicago Whole Foods. She returned some green peppers to the shelf, she said, because they were too expensive.Under PressureWhole Foods’ shares have lost nearly half their value.April 10, 2017Investors led by Jana Partners disclose 8.8% stakeOct. 2013Stock hits all-time high$7060Sept. 2015Says it will cut 1,500 jobs over two years504030Nov. 2015Company says quarterly same-store salesdeclined for the first time since the recession20Nov. 2016Says Walter Robb will step down as co-CEO10020142015201320162017Source: FactSetTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL.Under PressureWhole Foods’ shares have lost nearly half their value.April 10, 2017Investors led by Jana Partners disclose 8.8% stakeOct. 2013Stock hits all-time high$7060Sept. 2015Says it will cut 1,500 jobs over two years504030Nov. 2015Company says quarterly same-store salesdeclined for the first time since the recession20Nov. 2016Says Walter Robb will step down as co-CEO10020152016201420172013Source: FactSetTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL.Under PressureWhole Foods’ shares have lost nearly half their value.April 10, 2017Investors led by Jana Partners disclose 8.8% stakeOct. 2013Stock hits all-time high$7060Sept. 2015Says it will cut 1,500 jobs over two years504030Nov. 2015Company says quarterly same-store salesdeclined for the first time since the recession20Nov. 2016Says Walter Robb will step down as co-CEO10020162017201320152014Source: FactSetTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL.Under PressureWhole Foods’ shares have lost nearly half their value.April 10, 2017Investors led by Jana Partners disclose 8.8% stakeOct. 2013Stock hits all-time high$7060Sept. 2015Says it will cut 1,500jobs over two years5040Nov. 2015Company says quarterly same-store sales declined for the first time since the recession3020Nov. 2016Says Walter Robb will step down as co-CEO100’14’15’17’13’16Source: FactSetTHE WALL STREET JOURNAL.Last fall, as the problems worsened, Mr. Mackey and Mr. Robb began discussing ending their unusual dual-CEO structure. Mr. Mackey said the company needed a clearer line of reporting. Both men discussed becoming the sole CEO. Mr. Mackey, who for years had focused on the company’s long-term mission and his vision for the brand, said he wasn’t ready to step aside.“I feel like I’m madly in love with Whole Foods Market right now,” says Mr. Mackey.Some industry executives and analysts say Mr. Robb has more experience running day-to-day operations, and they question whether Mr. Mackey is up to the job. Mr. Robb, who remains a board member, didn’t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Mackey says various senior executives run Whole Foods’ operations, including former Target Corp. executive Don Clark, who is overhauling the company’s global purchasing to run more like a traditional retailer.As part of what Mr. Mackey calls a “transformation phase,” Whole Foods formulated a nine-point plan to cut costs and focus on its most loyal customers, a concession that it can’t cater to all markets or demographics.Mr. Mackey acknowledges that some families can’t afford Whole Foods or don’t care enough about his mission. The company doesn’t do as well “in the suburbs with people who have an expensive mortgage, they have 3½ children and a golden retriever,” he says.In the past year, Whole Foods began buying television advertising and distributing paper circulars, two moves that cut into profit. Mr. Mackey abruptly abandoned plans to triple the number of Whole Foods stores in the U.S., and said that underperforming locations would close. Other planned stores are being delayed indefinitely.The company needs to cut costs, but layoffs already have thinned store staffing, prompting customer complaints, former store managers say. Centralizing purchasing will save money, but it will mean fewer local brands on shelves, suppliers say.A Whole Foods spokeswoman said the employee cutbacks targeted redundant jobs, and it has new systems to help ensure sufficient staff. Small suppliers still have access to shelves through regional buyers, but big ones now need to pitch headquarters, she said. Some investors who have held company stock for years because they believe in Whole Foods’ mission say they will sell if the company strays too far from that vision. “We’ll change our minds if their behavior changes,” says Russ Piazza of Front Street Capital Management, a small fund with a stake.Wall Street analysts largely welcomed the news of Jana’s involvement, but many were unsure whether it would improve the company’s performance.Mary Ellen Coe, a Google.com executive and Whole Foods board member, says the company’s problems are common in retail, and “the urgency and the execution is there now.” Mr. Mackey, who identifies himself as a Libertarian, says he views the explosion in natural-food offerings that is hurting Whole Foods’s finances as “fantastic,” evidence that he achieved his goal of bringing such products to the masses. “In capitalism; that’s how it works,” he says.He says he is confident that Whole Foods will survive and be on surer footing in a year. “We have a billion dollars in the bank,” he says. “We are not in crisis mode.”“When times are good, people think I’m like a visionary leader,” he says. “And then the company hits a down cycle, and then everybody questions that.” “I’m like a duck,” he says. “The water goes off my back.” Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com and Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com Appeared in the Apr. 13, 2017, print edition as 'Whole Foods Gives In to Price Sensitivity.'

      "text" : "Larry Long, director of the Durant Boys and Girls Club, helps serve hot dogs to children there. (Cooper Neill/For The Washington Post) DURANT, Okla. — At the Boys and Girls Club in this rural city in southern Oklahoma, the director is unsure how he will stay open if President Trump’s proposed budget goes through, eliminating money for several staff positions. Similar conversations are happening at the Oklahoma Shakespearean Festival’s after-school arts program, which relies on National Endowment for the Arts grants that Trump wants to eliminate. And at the county senior center, which already lost its state funding and could lose all or most of its federal funding, too. And at the Farm Service Center, which supports 1,200 local producers and is staffed with employees whose positions were targeted in the budget. In this town of 16,000 — located near the Texas border in Oklahoma’s Bryan County, where Trump won 76 percent of the vote — excitement about Trump’s presidency has been dulled by confusion over an agenda that seems aimed at hurting their community more than helping it. The president’s proposed budget would disproportionately harm the rural areas and small towns that were key to his unexpected win. Many red states like Oklahoma — where every single county went for Trump — are more reliant on the federal funds that Trump wants to cut than states that voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Durant has already undergone years of state budget cuts, as Oklahoma has been unable to balance its increasing costs with declines in the oil industry, tax cuts and generous corporate tax credits. That has made federal funds even more vital to the city, especially for programs that serve the poor and working class. “It’s very easy to look at a laundry list of things that exist and say, ‘Cut, cut, cut, cut,’ and say, ‘Well, this is wasteful spending’ without really understanding the true impact,” said Durant City Manager Tim Rundel, who grew up in poverty in northwest Arkansas. “The bottom line is a lot of our citizens depend on those programs.” Residents stand for the Pledge of Allegiance before lunch at the Robert T. Davis Senior Center in Durant. (Cooper Neill/For The Washington Post) ‘It’s the only bright spot’ Betty Harris, 77, gets choked up when she talks about her husband, who died in May, and her son, who died in February. Her two daughters live in Oklahoma City and visit once a month or so. There are two things that get her to leave her home: a quilting circle with friends and daily visits to the senior center. The center offers lunch for two bucks, exercise classes, gospel singalongs, tax preparation help, monthly boxes of food for low-income seniors, a meal delivery program and a staff that can patiently explain Medicare or how to operate a cellphone. If someone doesn’t show up, the others quickly figure out why. “It’s the only bright spot,” said Harris, who used to work for AT&T. “It makes me get dressed and get out of the house.” Harris voted for Barack Obama when he first ran for president in 2008 because she liked his promise of change. But he disappointed her in a number of ways, including, in her eyes, being too sympathetic to Muslims. She voted for Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and Trump last year. She likes the president’s promises to crack down on illegal immigration, which she thinks has hurt the job market, and to bully manufacturers into staying in the country. She said both of her daughters were out of work for months because they worked for companies that moved overseas. But Harris is upset by the president’s proposed budget, which would dramatically cut funding for the Robert T. Davis Senior Center, managed by the Bryan County Retired Senior Volunteer Program. Harris said she gives each president 10 strikes before she withdraws her support. “I have high hopes for Trump, but if he’s going to be cutting these kinds of programs, that’s going to be one,” Harris said. “And we’ll see. I hope I don’t get up to 10, but I will give him one for that.” Trump wants to eliminate the federal Corporation for National and Community Service, which provides the county volunteer program with about $35,000 each year. This money goes to pay for supplemental insurance and mileage for volunteers who serve in the area, deliver meals to the county’s homebound and drive the elderly to medical appointments, including taking veterans to the closest VA medical center, 100 miles away in Dallas. The center also indirectly receives federal funds to pay for meals, which also could be cut. Maudie Anderson, 95, leads a bingo game at the Robert T. Davis Senior Center in Durant. (Cooper Neill/For The Washington Post) The center has already lost the $28,000 it used to receive each year in state funding, and United Way recently announced it would reduce its annual contribution from $10,000 to $7,500, said Executive Director Sheila Risner. She cut her salary, cut the hours of another employee and pared back some services, including reducing the number of trips to Dallas. As lunch trays were cleared away one recent afternoon, a table of seniors debated the proposed cuts. Bert Briedwell, a 74-year-old who is retired from an engineering consulting company and voted for Clinton, agrees with giving more funding to the military — but not at the expense of programs such as this one. “What would God say if you said, I’m going to take all of this money away from the poor and give it to airplanes?” said Briedwell, a member of the Choctaw Nation, which is headquartered in Durant. “We have enough of that already.” Clyde Glenn, 79, responded that there is a lot of waste in social programs. “If North Korea shoots a missile and it hits the United States and knocks out our power grid, then you’ll be saying: ‘How come nothing works no more?’ ” said Glenn, a Navy veteran who owns rental properties in the area and voted for Trump. “Look at all of the missiles we got — you don’t think we can take on North Korea?” Briedwell fired back. “My God, Clyde.” One of the women at the table sighed: “You got him going now.” Jackie Garner, a bookkeeper at the senior center who volunteered to reduce her hours so it wouldn’t have to cut even more services, jumped in to say that the Christian community should be doing more to care for those in need, as God instructed his followers — not the government. “At my house, if we don’t have that money, we don’t have that money. We don’t go out and spend money that we don’t have,” said Garner, 57. “We try to find alternative ways to make the things that are important happen. I expect the government to do the same. It’s our tax dollars. We need to be good stewards.” “I see what you’re saying, hon,” Briedwell said, “But don’t you agree with me? Why take it and give it to the military that’s the strongest military in the world?” As the debate continued, Glenn shook his head and said: “It used to be that when somebody won a sports game, a politic game, whatever, the loser must be gracious and let it go. . . . He won. So let’s accept that and let it go and see what he can do.” An old brick road surface is exposed where asphalt has broken apart on a street in Durant. (Cooper Neill/For The Washington Post) ‘We just don’t have the resources’ A drive along Durant’s Main Street reveals the problems facing many small towns — problems that Trump promised to fix. “This is our Main Street, going right through the heart of Durant, and you’re going to quickly see why some of our citizens are somewhat frustrated,” said Rundel, the city manager, as his pickup truck rumbled over potholes that often extend through layers of patches to a historic brick road below. Four workers are assigned to patch the city’s nearly 200 miles of road, which Rundel compares to applying a temporary bandage to a gaping wound. There’s just never enough money left in the annual $30 million budget to tear up and replace Main Street and other main roadways. It would take at least $20 million to update the roads, he said. “We just don’t have the resources,” Rundel said. It would cost another $10 million to $20 million to update the city’s generations-old water treatment and sewer systems, the life of which has been extended by city workers willing to come up with creative fixes and build their own parts. Trump’s budget promises “robust funding for critical drinking and wastewater infrastructure,” but it also would eliminate a $498 million grant and loan program that helps rural communities that are smaller than Durant upgrade their water and wastewater systems. Heading east on Main Street — past the “world’s largest peanut” outside City Hall — takes you over railroad tracks and into a deeply impoverished neighborhood. One in four Durant residents lives in poverty. In 2014, President Barack Obama designated the Durant-based Choctaw Nation as a “Promise Zone” and the recipient of a rush of federal funds that enabled an expansion of Head Start programs for young children and Internet access for more than 425 public housing residents. An eco-friendly steel mill is slated to open this fall, providing as many as 300 new jobs, thanks to a New Markets Tax Credit of $21 million that encourages building in areas with high unemployment rates. Durant is already home to a number of industrial plants — including a Big Lots distribution center and a glass factory — and has been growing. But to continue to add all of the jobs Trump promised, Rundel said the city has to strengthen its strained infrastructure. Trump promised that within 100 days of taking office he would introduce legislation to “spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over ten years.” He has yet to do so. And when his aides discuss infrastructure, they talk more about toll roads, pipelines and major airports than crumbling Main Streets. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, pushed back at the idea that the budget hits rural areas especially hard. “President Trump was elected to represent all Americans — rich and poor, rural and urban,” he said. “His administration and his budget prioritize American security and economic success, while at the same time recognizing that we must be mindful of every tax dollar spent, given our nearly $20 trillion national debt.” There is hope among many Trump supporters that the possible budget sacrifices will be worth it. Rick Munholland, 64, owns a tire shop near the train tracks on Main Street and said customers often ask to purchase tires made in the United States, which are difficult to find. He wants to see more jobs in the area, fewer undocumented immigrants and a reduction in his monthly health-insurance premiums, as it costs $2,800 a month for a small-business plan that covers him, his wife and one employee. “Working people like me can’t afford it. Now, if you’re low-income, they can get it for nothing — but the low-income gets taken care of regardless,” Munholland said. “God bless America, but it has gone to the dogs.” A painting in Durant. (Cooper Neill/For The Washington Post) ‘These things are vital’ When Crystal Tate was in middle school, she attended a week-long program that took her and other low-income students to visit college campuses in Oklahoma and Texas, introducing them to a world that can be foreign and intimidating. The trip was organized by Talent Search, a program offered through the decades-old federal program TRIO, which helps first-generation, low-income students get into college and graduate by providing the support they may not be receiving at home. Trump wants to cut TRIO and another initiative called GEAR UP by $193 million, saying many such programs are redundant and there is limited evidence that some of the initiatives work — assertions that Tate and university officials wholeheartedly reject. Tate is now 21 and a junior at Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant, studying to become a teacher. She pays for college with a combination of Pell Grants, which the president has pledged to protect, and other scholarships. She lives with her grandparents in Boswell, about 30 miles away, so that she can coach girls’ sports teams there. Out of Tate’s graduating high school class of 17, six attempted college or a trade school and only two stuck with it, including her. She plans to be the first college graduate in her immediate family. “School was a place where I felt at home, where I felt like I could be part of something bigger than myself,” said Tate, who did not vote in November. “And in order for me to further my ability to be something better than myself, I knew that college would have to happen.” For students trying to break out of poverty, the cuts come from multiple directions. The Durant public school system superintendent has seen state funding dramatically decline since 2009, and he is worried his classrooms will suffer if Trump directs more federal funds to school vouchers and urban charter schools. The Durant-based Oklahoma Shakespearean Festival offers a summer theater camp and after-school theater, dance and music classes to local students, many of whom come from poor families. The festival used to receive $150,000 a year in state and federal funds, which have been slashed to $26,000 a year, including NEA grants that Trump wants to eliminate. And the Boys and Girls Club of Durant watches over about 200 children and teenagers each day after school and during the summer in a former middle school that is being renovated. More than half of the students are Native American and 20 percent live with their grandparents or in foster care. “From 3 o’clock to 6 o’clock in the evening is the worst time for kids — that’s when kids get in trouble, get into vandalism, when young ladies get pregnant,” said Executive Director Larry Long, 69, who attended a Boys and Girls Club in Missouri as a child. “We keep them busy.” Long has to hustle to keep the club safe, clean and operating. About one-third of funding comes from the federal government, while the rest comes from donations, fees paid by families and other sources. Long would lose three of his part-time employees if Trump eliminates the Senior Community Service Employment Program, which pairs low-income people over the age of 55 with government-subsidized jobs at nonprofits and public agencies. The Trump administration says the $434 million program has failed to transition enough of these workers into unsubsidized jobs.

      "text" : "By Steve Holland | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON The White House is considering a draft executive order to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a senior Trump administration official said on Wednesday.It was unclear whether the order would be enacted by President Donald Trump, who has vowed to pull out from NAFTA - a U.S., Mexico and Canada trade pact - if he cannot win better terms for America.But the action under consideration could signal heightened prospects that one of the world's biggest trading blocs could unravel in an economically damaging dispute.The possible executive order, first reported by Politico, sent stocks and currencies falling in Mexico and Canada. Investors were rethinking their assumptions that Trump would back away from some of the drastic actions on trade that he had promised during the presidential campaign.\"It is a clear indication that they (in the White House) are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges,\" said Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada. Trump has long accused Mexico of destroying U.S. jobs and recently ramped up his criticism of Canada, saying last week that Ottawa's protection of its dairy industry was \"unfair.\"Trump this week ordered 20 percent tariffs on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, setting a tense tone as the three countries prepared to renegotiate the 23-year-old trade pact. The U.S. president has faced a series of setbacks since he took office in January, with courts blocking parts of his orders to limit immigration and the Republican-controlled Congress pulling legislation he backed to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system.As president, Trump has broad authority on trade policy, including the power to withdraw from NAFTA without votes by Congress, according to many legal analysts. It was under an executive order signed by Trump on Jan. 23 that the United States pulled out of the sweeping Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.Mexico had expected to start NAFTA renegotiations in August but the possible executive order could add urgency to the timeline. Trump criticized Mexico extensively during his presidential campaign. The United States went from running a small trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63 billion deficit in 2016.Canada said it was ready to come to talks on renewing NAFTA at any time.\"At this moment NAFTA negotiations have not started. Canada is ready to come to the table at any time,\" said Alex Lawrence, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland.

By Louis Nelson04/18/17 10:57 AM EDT Updated 04/18/17 12:06 PM EDTDemocratic congressional candidate Jon Ossoff said Tuesday that he’s “been very transparent” about the fact that he lives outside the Georgia district he is running to represent, telling CNN that he moved outside it to accommodate his girlfriend’s medical studies.Polls for the special election to fill the congressional seat left vacant by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price opened Tuesday morning in Georgia’s 6th District, where Ossoff leads a crowded field that features 11 Republicans and 18 candidates overall. The 30-year-old Ossoff has benefited from an influx of support and cash from Democrats nationwide eager for a chance to deal President Donald Trump and the GOP an embarrassing defeat in a deep-red district.Story Continued BelowRepublicans, who have not united behind one of the party’s 11 candidates for the seat, have attacked Ossoff by linking him to Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and by running ads noting that he lives outside the district where he is seeking office. Ossoff defended his 6th District roots Tuesday in an interview with CNN’s “New Day.”“Well, I grew up in this district. I grew up in this community. No one knew there was going to be an election coming,” Ossoff said when asked whether he would be able to vote for himself in Tuesday’s election, something he will not be able to do. “I’ve been living with Alisha, my girlfriend of 12 years, down by Emory University, where she’s a full-time medical student. And as soon as she concludes her medical training, I’ll be 10 minutes back up the street into the district where I grew up, but I want to support her and her career and do right by her.” Playbook Plus Anchor Alisyn Camerota jokingly asked Ossoff when he planned to marry his longtime girlfriend, to which he replied, “I don’t want to give anything away,” with a laugh, telling the CNN host that he didn’t want to answer such a personal question. When Camerota pushed Ossoff again about his residence, Ossoff said he is “proud to be supporting [his girlfriend’s] career” and reiterated that he plans to move back to the 6th District as soon as his girlfriend finishes medical school.“It’s my home. My family is still there,” he said. “I am a mile-and-a-half down the street to support Alisha while she finishes medical school. It’s something I’ve been very transparent about.”To win the 6th District seat on Tuesday, Ossoff would need to secure better than 50 percent of the vote, a threshold that polling has shown him likely to fall just short of. If no candidate hits 50 percent, the top two, regardless of party, will be placed in a runoff election in June. Such a runoff would be a much tougher hurdle for Ossoff, likely against a single Republican opponent instead of the splintered field he is facing in Tuesday’s race.Missing out on the latest scoops?

      "text" : "PARIS — French voters on Sunday rejected the two political parties that dominated France’s post-World War II political life, pitting an anti-immigrant firebrand against an unconventional centrist in a presidential election that could determine the future of the European Union and France’s place in the world. By picking the pro-E.U. former economy minister Emmanuel Macron and National Front leader Marine Le Pen to advance to the decisive May 7 runoff, French citizens set up a stark choice. Now there will be a battle between a contender who wants to seal France tight against the tides of globalization and another who seeks to strip away even more barriers with the rest of the world. The victor could determine whether the international alliances that formed the backbone of the West after World War II will strengthen or be shattered by the force of nationalism. Le Pen has said she will seek to pull France out of the European Union, a move many leaders on the continent think would doom the 28-nation bloc; she also said she would rekindle relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin after years of strife between Russia and the West. Macron has called for a more muscular European Union in which Europe’s richest nations would do more to prop up their poorer neighbors. [WorldViews: What you need to know about the French election] If Le Pen wins, she will continue a global string of ballot-box revolutions that began last year with the British decision to leave the European Union and continued with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. With her fierce anti-immigration agenda and her vow to keep France for the French, she could be a Gallic counterpart to President Trump. But if Macron triumphs — and polls suggest he will, by a 24 percentage point margin — it would be a further barrier to transatlantic disruptions, at least for now, after Dutch voters rejected a far-right leader in March elections. Who is Marine Le Pen?

(Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) At the jubilant Macron rally in Paris, the centrist candidate who was Socialist President François Hollande’s economy minister told his supporters France would prosper in a revitalized European Union. “I’ve heard the anger, the fears of the French people, their fear of change,” the 39-year-old Macron said, winking at his cheering audience. “I want to be the president of all patriots against the nationalist threat.” [A youth revolt in France boosts the far right] At Le Pen’s rally in Henin-Beaumont, a northern French town hit hard by factory closures, the modest assortment of soft drinks and snacks gave it more the feeling of a country fair than the celebration of an ascendant presidential campaign — exactly the everyman image Le Pen has sought to project. “What is at stake in this election is a referendum for or against lawless globalization,” Le Pen told the cheering crowd. “Either you choose in favor of a total lack of rules, without borders, with unlawful competition, the free circulation of terrorists, or you make the choice of a France that protects. “This is truly what is at stake. It is the survival of France,” she said. The vote came after a turbulent campaign in which longtime pillars of France’s political establishment were either rejected by voters or discredited by scandal. Hollande, the most unpopular of all postwar French presidents, said he would not seek reelection. His most prominent Socialist successor lost to a primary challenger. So did the former center-right president, Nicolas Sarkozy. The early front-runner in the race, François Fillon, a right-wing challenger who sought a Margaret Thatcher-style overhaul of France’s economy, fell prey to a nepotism scandal. 1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × EmbedCopyShare See photos of French citizens voting for their new president View Photos Centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen qualify to move on to the second round on May 7th.

Le Pen followed with 21.5 percent. Many voters said they were opting for the least bad of an unpalatable slate of options. “I want nobody, and it’s very complicated. I just don’t want to see the extremes,” said Emma Lacour, 42, who voted Sunday in the upscale Saint-Cloud suburb of Paris, where conservatives usually dominate. “I decided two minutes ago, and I’m not very happy,” said Lacour, who was too dispirited to say whom she picked as she walked out of the ornate 19th-century city hall that held the voting station. Thursday’s attack on police officers patrolling Paris’s glittering Champs-Elysees boulevard was the final, bloody exclamation point in a campaign that often revolved around fears of terrorism and immigrants. One officer died and two were wounded by a gunman who pledged loyalty to the Islamic State. [France’s terrorism problem divided the country. The election could make it worse.] Filled with fresh worries about security, voters may have been drawn by Le Pen’s growling message about refugees and terror suspects. Macron, a newcomer who is far more conversant with boardrooms than he is with situation rooms, has sought to boost his security bona fides. A former investment banker and a product of France’s elite educational institutions, he has described himself as a candidate of neither the left nor the right, and he has never held an elected office. His agenda marries social liberalism with proposals that would dilute France’s traditionally robust protections for workers. And — despite prevailing winds that make pro-E.U. sentiment an unlikely campaign strategy — he has embraced the union and said he wants to make it stronger. “I’m hoping for the renewal of the French political scene,” said Catherine Grevelink, 56, who oversees legal issues at a bank and voted for Macron in Saint-Cloud. “He’s very intelligent. Now we have to see how this comes out as he governs, if he is president.” Either of the winning candidates would face questions about governing, since neither has a party structure in France’s Parliament. Macron’s movement is too new to have any lawmakers, and Le Pen would face steep challenges in capturing a majority of the National Assembly in elections scheduled for June 11. That could potentially be a brake to her more ambitious plans, such as taking France out of the European Union. E.U. membership is enshrined in the constitution, and any change would require approval in both houses of Parliament. Sunday’s result is a vindication of Le Pen’s years-long strategy to destigmatize her party after decades in which it lurked on France’s far-right fringe. Her father notoriously described the Nazi gas chambers as “a detail” of World War II. But Le Pen, 48, sought to make inroads among France’s large Jewish community and also depicted herself as the single true defender of French workers. “The laws are there already, but no one applies them, as the attack in Paris showed,” said Martine Le Roy, 62, a retired insurance worker from Henin-Beaumont. She said she was supporting the anti-immigrant, hard-line Le Pen because she was worried about security. Even as Macron and Le Pen advanced to the next round, the sheer uncertainty in the lead-up to Sunday’s vote was a measure of the unmooring of French political life. “We’ve had two consecutive presidents, Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, very different orientations, very different policies, but still we have the same economic problems,” said Bruno Cautrès, who studies voting behavior at the Center for Political Research at Sciences Po in Paris. “It has been one of the best arguments of Marine Le Pen: ‘Why not me?’ ” world europe Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

See all newsletters Although most opinion polls suggest that Macron would win at least 60 percent of a head-to-head vote against Le Pen, an unforeseeable event — such as a large-scale terrorist attack — could shift votes in Le Pen’s direction. And the far-left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who electrified crowds of young voters with his soak-the-rich message, notably held back Sunday from asking his supporters to vote for Macron in the runoff, raising the prospect that some of his boosters — 19.6 percent of Sunday’s voters — could stay home or even vote for Le Pen. Backers of other candidates could also swing to Le Pen. If Le Pen ultimately falls to Macron, she will still have taken the far-right further than any prior candidate in one of Europe’s pillar nations. If her rival is elected but fails to live up to expectations, she could seize the presidency in the next election in five years, analysts said. “If she does well, she could be even stronger in 2022,” said Jean-Yves Camus, an expert on the French far right at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.

      "text" : "Like ​The Atlantic? Subscribe to ​The Atlantic Daily​, our free weekday email newsletter. It’s rare to think about it, but moving your eyes back and forth over lines of text is one of the most commonly performed bodily motions.When reading, your eyes go from word to word, left to right, one after another. When you hit the end of the line, your eyes make what’s called a return sweep. They go back to the left, to the beginning of the next line. During that sweep, we get a little time to process information. (Are you thinking about it now?)That sweep is also where many of us mess up. We lose time. Most people don’t go all the way back to the first word, for example. We tend to land on the second or third word in a line, and then make another backwards movement to get to that first word. That’s inefficient.Like any physical movement, they’re a matter of practice and coordination. The mechanics of getting text into one’s brain require skill apart from that involved in processing the meaning in that text. As with something like swimming or skateboarding, it’s a skill where most people can become proficient, but everyone’s capacity for speed and precision is not equal.But there are ways to enhance our abilities.To illustrate this, try reading this passage (from Larry McMurtry's All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers):Then try reading it like this:The colors in this text are rendered in a precise and strategic way, designed to help people read quickly and accurately.The most important feature is that each line begins with a different color than the line above or below. As Matthew Schneps, director of the Laboratory for Visual Learning at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, explained it to me, the color gradients also pull our eyes long from one character to the next—and then from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, minimizing any chance of skipping lines or making anything less than an optimally efficient word-to-word or line-to-line transition.Improving the ease and accuracy of the return sweep is a promising idea for readers of all skill levels. And yet it’s one that’s gone largely ignored in the milieu of media technologies. Today many of us read primarily on screens–and we have for years–yet most platforms have focused on using technology to attempt to recreate text as it appears in books (or in newspapers or magazines), instead of trying to create an optimal reading experience.The format—black text on white lines of 12 to 15 words of equal size—is a relic of the way that books were most easily printed on early printing presses. It persists today out of tradition, not because of some innate tendency of the human brain to process information in this way.Meanwhile, people who aren’t especially skilled at intake of text in the traditional format are systematically penalized. People who don’t read well in this one particular way tend to fall behind scholastically early in life. They might be told they’re not as bright as other people, or at least come to assume it. They might even be diagnosed with ADHD, dyslexia, or a learning disability, or overlooked as academically mediocre.“The book format was effective, but not for everyone,” said Schneps. “This is not just technology that could help people who are struggling with reading; this is technology that could help a lot of people.”* * *Our minds are not as uniform as our text. We all take in information in different ways. Some people read more quickly and retain more information when lines are shorter, or when fonts are bolder, or in different colors. The color-gradient pattern above is rendered by a product called BeeLine, developed by armchair linguist Nick Lum. He got the idea after learning about the Stroop Effect, the famous phenomenon where it becomes difficult to read words like “yellow” and “red” when they are written in different colors. Lum thought, “What if instead of screwing people up, we tried to use color in a way that helps people?”After he won the Stanford Social Entrepreneurship and Dell Education startup competitions with the idea in 2014, Lum took to developing the technology full time. So far, the response from people tends to be binary: for some it’s a shrug, but for others, particularly people with dyslexias, it’s like turning on a light bulb. As Lum describes it, people tell him “Holy cow, this is how everybody else reads.”The idea has been well received by reading experts, too.“Most of the academic research is figuring out entirely what your eyes are going to do on one line,” said psychologist and Microsoft researcher Kevin Larson. “That has been such a challenge that it's rare for anyone to pay much attention to what happens during that line return movement.”At the University of Texas at Austin, Randolph Bias has studied the optimal length of lines of text for reading comprehension and speed. The two are generally at odds: Short lines make for a quick and accurate return (the movement is easier because it allows our eyes to take a greater downward angle than if the line were longer.) The downside is that because our brains process information during return sweeps, shorter lines don't afford us that time. We also don’t get to take full advantage of peripheral vision – which is key. (He cites this as the problem with Spritz, the reading technology where single words rapidly flash before a reader.)“Human beings have evolved to be able to take in 12 to 16 letters—at least—at a fixation,” Bias explained to me. This is known as our span of perception. “Just as some people are taller, some people can take in more at a time.”So, long lines of text are better if you can minimize line-transition problems. And using color gradients seems to be one way to do that. Last year, optometrist Carole Hong did an initial, small study (not peer-reviewed, for the company) where she watched the eye movements of people as they read with BeeLine, and most of them skipped fewer lines–and experienced fewer backward saccades–than when reading in black text.“BeeLine gives the reader a cue as to where that next line is – an excellent, unavoidable cue,” explained Bias. “I think that's brilliant. It might be the first in a series of creative ways we break out of traditional formats of text – where we take full advantage of online capabilities instead of just plopping a book into a doc file.”Beeline launched softly, accidentally, on the site Hacker News in 2013. At that point it was just a bookmarklet (the lamest version of a browser plugin), and the first version of the chrome extension. Even still, the concept captured enormous attention in the ADHD community on Tumblr.“It wasn't envisioned as an assistive technology,” said Lum, “but after the launch on Hacker News, we got all kinds of emails from people with ADHD. The folks on Tumblr are heavily in the ADHD and dyslexia camps.”The color gradients might be helpful not just with return sweeps, but simply in keeping people’s attention – so they’re less likely to dart from tab to tab. Bias sees an important role for this technology in the era of waning attention spans. He’s 64 years old and describes himself as a “slow but good reader” who “can sometimes stay with something for a long time.” But in recent years, he’s sensed a decline in his attention, and has a feeling that this is a growing problem. “Can we multitask?” he asks, rhetorically. “The research, more and more, shows that we all suck at it.”And as the definitions of paying attention and reading shift, narrowing the focus of technology like BeeLine to people with ADHD and dyslexia is missing the point. If changes in format like adding color gradients can help prevent loss of attention, then it necessarily helps with reading (retention and speed). Schneps says that what’s needed is a complete shift in thinking about normalcy—and why there is one default state for almost all text.At Microsoft in Seattle, for example, Larson has been working for 19 years studying word recognition and reading acquisition. When he started, he recalls, very few people would read any long document on screen. If they got a long email, they would print it out. “But now,” he notes, “that would be an outrageous thing to do.”The task now is to make digital reading better than reading in print. One of Larson’s passions has been working to prove that we take in words not as entities unto themselves (as some typographers have argued), but always by recognizing a word’s component letters, and then assembling them into words in our heads. His team also recently launched a new font that was designed for the best possible readability. Called Sitka, it went through a multistep, iterative design-test process. Each letter was changed and adjusted to maximize ease of reading – as opposed to most other fonts, which are made to mimic typefaces that existed in print media. “Times New Roman was designed to work very well with the technology of the era,” Laston explained. (I asked him if he has, then, created the most legible font in history. He said he “wouldn’t go that far.”)It's not the color itself that's useful in Beeline, Larson believes, but the connection of the end of one line to the beginning of another. He suggests that for people who are colorblind or simply averse to the colored text, the same thing could be accomplished using bolder text or different fonts to draw people’s eyes along. “A feature like Beeline can encourage people to move from print to digital,” he said.Indeed, many print media publications have struggled in recent years, but many persist—largely on the justification that people still like to sit back and hold a book or magazine in their hands. But if the digital reading experience continues to improve—adding value beyond mere portability—that could make analog reading ever more niche.The magazine CNET recently partnered with BeeLine to published two fiction pieces online, where readers had the option to turn the colors on or off. Jeremy Toeman, vice president of products at CNET, was instantly attracted to the technology. “We're all spending more and more time on screens, and getting tired of seeing black words on white backgrounds for hours and hours on end,” he said, “so anything that helps with that seems good.\"And the analytic data from the BeeLine trial at CNET suggests people like it. Readers who used the color gradients were more likely to read further down the page than people who didn’t—and more likely to read to the end. Depth that they read down on the page was almost half-again as much as other readers.’ In the world of digital media, this is not just a valuable metric, but possibly the most valuable. This is the type of authentic audience engagement that’s monetizable. Anyone can generate clicks; not many can compel people to read an entire article, when it is essentially competing for a person’s attention against every other thing that’s happening on the entire, enormous Internet.As most of the world’s readers move toward reading primarily on mobile devices, smaller screens mean not just smaller text, but larger variations in ambience. The mobile reading environment is rarely as friendly as the desktop environment. You're not parked in a quiet office, but commuting on a subway that’s accelerating and decelerating, and your very small text is moving in three dimensions, and your eyes need to track across and between lines. That's much harder to do when you and the device are moving semi-independently.\"If we can get people to read more, in this era where everyone is swiping through everything in a millisecond,” Toeman said, “then I think that's great technology.\"The other big opportunity for the technology is in educational settings. Later this year, BeeLine will be rolling out in libraries across California, as part of a licensing partnership. This is how Lum sees the company growing. The basic Google Chrome extension and iPhone app are free. But large-scale licensing deals with platforms and institutions like school systems could be more lucrative—and make the option accessible to people who wouldn’t otherwise think to try reading in color.In early experiments, some students do seem to benefit from the color gradients. Last year, first-grade students in two general-education classrooms in San Bernardino, California, tried out Beeline, and many did better with comprehension tests afterword. “Because of my background in visual processing, I immediately wanted to check it out,” said Michael Dominguez, an applied behavioral analyst who directs the San Bernardino school district’s special education program. “Based on everything I know, it should work great.” A suggestion for compulsive checkers",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-opens-door-to-democrats-in-wake-of-health-bill-failure-1490547877WASHINGTON—The White House, stung by the collapse of the House Republican health bill last week, is signaling it may be time to start working with moderate Democrats to enact President Donald Trump’s agenda, a shift with the potential to upend years of partisanship in Washington.“This president is not going to be a partisan president,” White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on “Fox News Sunday.” He said that while “I think it’s time for our folks to come together, I also think it’s time to potentially get a few moderate Democrats on board as well.”It was one of a rapid-fire series of signs that the Trump administration is fed up with many of the factions in the House Republican conference and is considering changing its legislative strategy. The president took to Twitter to criticize hard-line conservatives—known as the House Freedom Caucus—who had worked to topple the GOP health plan.“Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club for Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!” Mr. Trump wrote.Whether the Trump administration can work with Democrats remains an open question. While Mr. Trump’s ideological flexibility could open the door for some agreement, the president also would still have to bridge divides within the Republican Party. Moreover, the liberal wing of the Democratic base is suspicious of any efforts to work with Mr. Trump.“The minute he got into office, maybe led by Vice President Pence and some of the others, he moved so far to the hard right that it’s virtually impossible for us to work with him,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said on ABC’s “This Week.”The Trump administration on Sunday provided a reminder for Democrats about why they have opposed his presidency. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told ABC’s “This Week” that on Tuesday, Mr. Trump is expected to sign an executive order to undo President Barack Obama’s plan to curb global warming.“If anything, Democrats are feeling greater pressure from their activist base, which has tasted victory on health care and is even more convinced now in the wisdom of an outright resistance strategy,” said Brian Fallon, a longtime Democratic aide who is now the senior adviser to Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC.Mr. Trump will have two opportunities in coming months to shift his legislative strategy.The first comes over a spending bill that will need to be passed once a current measure that runs through April 28 expires. Congress and the White House will have to sort through divides over whether to increase military spending at the expense of domestic programs, a perennial fight.\nThe White House and Republicans have also made an overhaul of the tax code their next big legislative priority, a matter that is particularly fraught. If Mr. Trump produces a middle-class tax cut, there could be Democratic support. But his campaign plans featured significant rate cuts for high-income households, including a repeal of the estate tax. Tax policies along those lines wouldn’t find much favor among Democrats. “I don’t think they’re headed in the right direction,” Mr. Schumer said. “They’re going to repeat the same mistake they made on Trumpcare with tax reform.”Mr. Trump has also flashed signs of ambivalence about working with Democrats. On Saturday, he said that unified Democratic opposition was the reason the health bill was pulled, and he has also called Mr. Schumer the Democrats’ “head clown.”But the president and Mr. Schumer do have a relationship, and Mr. Trump has met with Senate Democrats such as Sens. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.). Mr. Trump has also repeatedly talked about working with House Democrats who are pushing a plan to allow the government to negotiate for lower drug prices and a large infrastructure project to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges is also a measure that could bring both sides to the table.The opening of the door to potential collaboration between Mr. Trump and Democrats took place against a backdrop of Republican infighting over whom to blame for the collapse of the health bill and where to go next.While hard-line conservatives said that legislation didn’t go far enough to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, middle-of-the-road Republicans said that the White House had them driven away by making too many concessions to conservatives. The main concession offered last week was to strike a requirement that insurance provide a minimum level of coverage for health services like maternity and mental-health care.“A lot of the concessions that the White House was making at the end of this process were to try to appease and placate the hard right,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R., Pa.) said on “Meet the Press.”Conservatives are defending their role in bringing down the House GOP health plan last week. Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), a former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said on “Fox News Sunday” that his group of 30 to 40 lawmakers had done the right thing because the House GOP plan fell short of party ideals.“Instead of doing the blame game, let’s get to work,” Mr. Jordan said.Mr. Ryan also ended up in the middle of the burgeoning controversy over who was to blame. On Saturday, Mr. Trump told his followers to “watch @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00 P.M.” In that show, host Jeanine Pirro started her segment by saying that “Paul Ryan needs to step down as Speaker of the House” because he didn’t deliver the votes to pass the health legislation and had sold Mr. Trump “a bill of goods.”White House officials said that Mr. Trump harbored no bad feelings toward Mr. Ryan and had promoted the show simply to help out the host.“I’ve never seen the president, for a second, try to blame Paul Ryan for this,” Office of Management and Budget Director Director Mick Mulvaney said on “Meet the Press.” AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, said that he and the president had spoken on Sunday. “The president was clear his tweet had nothing to do with the speaker,” she said. “They are both eager to get back to work on the agenda.”As for working with Republicans, Mr. Priebus said that “we’ll give these guys another chance.” But he said that his calls to consider working with Democrats amounted to “more or less a warning shot that we’re willing to talk to anyone—we always have been, and I think more so now than ever.”—Richard Rubin, Brent Kendall and Janet Hook contributed to this article.

      "text" : "Congress Liberal constituents aren't letting up on Republicans even after their Obamacare repeal bill stalled. By Kyle Cheney and Rachael Bade04/16/17 07:06 AM EDT Congressman Leonard Lance responds to questions from constituents during a town hall event at the Edward Nash Theater on the campus of Raritan Valley Community College on February 25 in Branchburg, New Jersey. | Getty By Michael Shermer By William J. Perry By Rebecca Burns By Daniel Benjamin and Steven SimonRepublicans eager to flee Capitol Hill after squandering weeks on failed negotiations to repeal Obamacare are finding little refuge at home, where furious throngs of liberal constituents await. Halfway through the two-week Easter break, it’s clear that the energy on the left to protect Barack Obama’s health care law — and oppose President Donald Trump — is still soaring.But for the first time, pro-Obamacare constituents have a specific target: the American Health Care Act. GOP lawmakers now face town halls after debuting a real piece of legislation to gut Obamacare, which added to the urgency and anger of the protests that greeted Republicans as they scattered across the country.Story Continued BelowPOLITICO reporters traveled to nearly a dozen town halls to document the tumultuous homecoming Republicans faced. Here are four takeaways from Congress’ first week on the road, with reporting from Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Oregon, New Jersey, New York and Texas.1) Republican AHCA critics sharpened their skepticism of the billAs Republican leaders eye an attempt to salvage their plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, they now are likely to have even more difficulty winning over wayward members.Republicans who opposed the bill, which was abruptly pulled from the floor last month, soaked up some support from their left-leaning constituents. They also vowed to protect Obamacare provisions that cover people with preexisting conditions. Heaven Chamberlain, of Des Moines, Iowa, asks Rep. David Young a question during a town hall meeting, on April 12, in Des Moines, Iowa. | AP PhotoThat could make it harder for centrists to find common ground with hard-line conservatives who are seeking to sharply weaken Obamacare's insurance mandates and regulations, including on preexisting conditions protections.But across all factions of the divided Republican Conference, lawmakers found one common way to generate applause from a hostile crowd: criticize the AHCA.Mainstream GOP Rep. David Young of Iowa found friends in his crowd who appreciated his decision to stake out opposition to the measure. Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, earned grudging support for suggesting he'd even prefer single-payer health care — which he hates — to Speaker Paul Ryan’s bill.Centrist Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey, who faced scorn for his initial support of the measure, earned some rare applause when he promised to reject any health care legislation that undermines coverage guarantees for people with preexisting conditions.Lance's experience illustrates the danger for any moderate Republicans who flirt with gutting Obamacare. He backed the measure when it traveled through the House Energy and Commerce Committee — and his constituents made sure he didn't forget it. Though Lance ultimately pledged to reject the AHCA, he still found himself fending off attacks.“I want you, and all of the Republicans, to sit down with the Democrats and fix the Affordable Care Act,” said Janet Katz of Chester, New Jersey, summing up the crowd’s sentiment. “I want this repeal crap to stop.”For moderates on record supporting the AHCA, the anger was palpable. An attendee asks a questions during a town hall meeting held by Rep. Joe Barton at Mansfield City Hall on April 13, in Mansfield, Texas. | GettyConstituents grilled Colorado centrist Republican Rep. Mike Coffman for supporting the Ryan bill at a frequently chaotic town hall on the outskirts of Denver. Even a man who called himself a “life-long registered Republican” stood up to shame Coffman for backing a measure he felt was too conservative for their district, which leans slightly Democratic.The room exploded with cheers when one person asked: “Will you commit to limiting premiums for people with pre-existing conditions so that they can actually afford health insurance?”Coffman tried to reassure the skeptical audience that people with histories of medical problems would be OK under the GOP plan, but it was largely in vain.Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), one of the few hard-line conservatives to ultimately endorse the AHCA, also got shouted down in his Texas district.\"No, not true!\" constituents yelled when he said the federal government had failed at administering the health care law.2) The House GOP’s civil war is getting noticed beyond the BeltwayAmericans have long watched from afar as feuding Republican factions have battled each other. But after the pivotal role played by the far-right House Freedom Caucus in sidelining the GOP health care bill, constituents are taking note of the schisms that drive the House Republican Conference.During Coffman's town hall, more than 1,600 miles from Washington, D.C., a young woman stood up to ask the Colorado Republican whether he was part of the Freedom Caucus — which doesn't post its full membership list — or the Tuesday Group, a 50-member band of moderate Republicans.She also asked whether it was appropriate for lawmakers to join these “secret societies.”Coffman appeared caught off guard by the question.“Secret societies? Whoa!” he exclaimed.Coffman acknowledged being part of the Tuesday Group but quickly noted he was also a member of the bipartisan \"No Labels\" caucus.That constituents are asking about the various factions in the House GOP Conference demonstrates just how ugly the intraparty fighting has gotten.Trump may also be driving the Freedom Caucus’ newfound notoriety. After Ryan was forced to pull his Obamacare alternative due to opposition from the caucus as well as a number of moderates, Trump began tweet-shaming the conservative group. He told his millions of followers that the hard-liners were blocking his agenda, and at least one White House aide even called for primary challengers to boot some of the group’s members from office. By Seung Min Kim and Daniel StraussYoho told his crowd he felt the Freedom Caucus was unfairly earning a bad rap.\"Yes, we wanted to be there for the president. Yes, we wanted to fix health care. But this wasn’t going to do it,” he said. “So, we had to go against supporting a brand new president that so many of our supporters put into office, to go against that and tell the president of the United States, 'Sir, this does not repeal Obamacare.’”3) Republicans have gotten better at handling hostile crowdsLawmakers were startled by the ferocity of the protests that greeted them at home in February.Raucous town halls led to viral moments like California Rep. Tom McClintock fleeing under heavy guard and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton getting dressed down by an attendee who supports Obamacare.This time, they were ready. They phoned in local police, imposed new security measures and tightened attendance availability, and it worked, to an extent.Republicans across the country appeared much more comfortable and better prepared to deal with noisy town hall crowds. Yoho didn't fire back when he was overwhelmed by angry constituents and protesters. Rather, he'd get down on one knee and gaze directly at his questioner, absorbing any heckling until he could finish his answer. Others defused tension with jokes, waiting out hecklers or pivoting to safe talking points.“Let’s do some more!” Coffman said when the moderator called for one last question, at an event that had already gone 45 minutes late. It was a stark contrast from a few months ago, when Coffman escaped out the back door of a town hall event that had been overrun by protesters. Constituents react after Congressman Leonard Lance responded to questions during a town hall event at the Edward Nash Theater on the campus of Raritan Valley Community College on February 25, in Branchburg, New Jersey. | GettyPart of that newfound confidence is due to increased vetting of town hall attendees.Coffman’s constituents, for instance, had to register and show their IDs at the door to prove they were actually constituents. Policemen also stood by and watched from the top of the auditorium. In one instance, they even escorted out a woman who make a ruckus about Coffman’s views on climate change.At Lance's event, a large security contingent confiscated signs from attendees. A ticketing system also appeared to limit the number of attendees, though Lance said he thought the somewhat smaller crowd size was because people were celebrating Passover.Rep. John Faso, who helped secure the bill’s much-maligned “Buffalo Bribe” to force the state of New York to pay more in Medicaid spending, opted for a television studio that could fit only about 70 constituents.When the New York Republican took heat for not holding a conventional town hall-style meeting, he argued his televised gathering was “a much more effective means of communicating” that would ensure “a civil discourse back and forth.”And in tiny Troy, Ohio, the local conservative group that hosted GOP Rep. Warren Davidson's event fought to maintain order amid protesters and hecklers.But unlike in many of the events across the country, Davidson's crowd was largely supportive of the freshman Freedom Caucus member. About two-thirds of the audience remained after Davidson's critics walked out en masse after he criticized Obamacare.There were, of course, other moments of tension around the country.Rep. Joe Wilson — who famously shouted \"You lie!\" at President Barack Obama during an address to Congress — was greeted with the same chant from his constituents. Oklahoma Rep. Markwayne Mullin took flak when he said it was \"bullcrap\" that taxpayers pay his salary.4) Taking on Trump is a winner for RepublicansIf Republicans were ever in need of a lifeline, challenging the president worked wonders in just about every town hall.Yoho, for example, said he now supports a measure that would compel presidential candidates, including Trump, to release their tax returns — and said he was convinced to do so by a liberal activist who urged him to ensure the president isn't participating in any \"funny business.\"Sign up for POLITICO Huddle.

Spicer later apologized, but Coffman wasn't satisfied.\"He needs to go,\" the Coloradan said to cheers, though they soon faded as talk turned back to health care.Victoria Colliver, Daniel Ducassi, Sarah Karlin-Smith, Renuka Rayasam, Elana Schor and Josefa Velasquez contributed to this report.Missing out on the latest scoops?

      "text" : "For our first-ever Love issue, we asked four authors to recount times when love and travel intersected in their lives: Alexander Chee writes about a possible betrayal in Spain. Jami Attenberg recalls how a friendship deepened in Sicily (below). Sarah Hepola remembers a road trip — and an uncertain future — in Mexico. And Sloane Crosley looks back at a relationship that took three trips to kill. We also have six writers recounting transformative moments that happened while traveling; a roundup of new hotels and resorts for all kinds of relationships, and a collection of readers’ stories of loves found and lost on the road.We met in Toronto, Viola Di Grado and I. We were attending a literary festival, and I saw her across the room in a crowded hospitality suite at a harborfront hotel, amid all the writers eagerly suckling the free liquor. She was 15 years my junior, an Italian baby goth princess: pin thin, long blond hair, a childlike face, wearing dark eyeliner and a dramatic black Victorian gown. I immediately thought: Her, I must know. We talked briefly and had an instant ease around each other, a major triumph among writers. (Most of us are inherently awkward creatures.) The next day we became friends on Facebook. It is always good to have a new contact in a foreign country, I remember thinking at the time. What more could I expect from this stranger I met for only a few moments?But over the four years that passed since we met, Viola became more than that. Even though we communicated only via the internet, having long, funny, intimate chats, she became a confidante (and, more recently, with my latest book, my Italian translator). I’ve read and loved her novels, which revolve around young, unconventional women who have complicated relationships with reality, and are often otherworldly. My favorite, “Hollow Heart,” is written from the perspective of a ghost, a suicide victim who is haunting the living.Viola is, predictably, wise beyond her years; emotionally, I am permanently trapped in my early 30s, so together we make a good friend match. I knew someday we would meet again; it was just a question of when and where.Then, last fall, my Italian publisher arranged a tour for me for my most recent book, starting in Milan and ending at my favorite Italian bookstore, Modusvivendi Libreria, in Palermo in Sicily. Viola is from Catania, on the opposite side of the island, about two and half hours away by bus. She agreed to meet me for two days, with two nights of readings at the store — a long time to spend with someone you have met only for a few minutes. Still, I loved the idea of an emotional adventure, taking a risk. We would see if our brief meeting four years before was a fluke or if our May-December friendship was built to last.I’d been to Palermo before, in 2014, to visit the same bookstore. My time there had been limited to one night and one day, and most of my exploring had involved hunting for street food along its back alleys. Palermo is a highly walkable city, with cobblestone streets that seem eternally damp, and, at least by daylight, safe. A day’s amble there seemed like a fine waste of time at that moment, though I didn’t leave Palermo knowing much more about it than when I had arrived. But now was my chance to get to know the city better.And we were off to a fine start as the bookstore had generously arranged for our lodgings in a literary-inspired Airbnb. Bed and Book is a sunny, bright, two-story building with bookshelves full of first editions, and an outdoor seating area where readings and book club discussions are held. Marco, the cool, young proprietor, has a Ph.D. in cultural studies and semiotics, and was writing a book about street and urban art. He even took us on a brief tour of Palermo street art.But Viola was to be my true guide. And Viola had opinions about Palermo, not to mention Italy in general. For me, the best way to get to know a city is the same as with a human being: learn both the flaws and the charms. I cannot fully love something until I know both. To my eye Palermo had seemed like a pretty, crumbling city, perhaps careless in its beauty. Viola saw something else.“It’s a Jackson Pollock painting in city form,” she said over coffee the next morning, before we set out on our adventure for the day. “There is an abstract quality in the structure of its everyday life, in the way cars and people and everything interact, and it’s very violent and unpredictable. Like, you never know, a car could hit you while you’re walking on the sidewalk.”I found this thrilling — not the getting hit by a car part, but the unpredictability. Anything could happen. After 18 years in New York City, I long always for a surprise.Viola suggested we spend our morning visiting the Capuchin Catacombs. We left our lodgings, taking the pedestrian path of the city’s oldest street, Via Vittorio Emanuele, home to many historic buildings as well as beautifully weathered, balconied apartments and tourist shops. We passed the broad and impressive Palermo Cathedral, its many towers softened by the occasional palm tree. And then we walked beneath the Porta Nuova, a triumphal arch that dates to the 1500s, and I felt as if I were leaving one part of the city for another.Until that point, everything had been tall and spacious, a testament, as I always feel in so many European cities, to masculinity. But as we veered up Via Cappuccini toward the catacombs, the streets grew more cluttered, the buildings more humble, the sidewalks more narrow and crowded with garbage and oddly parked vehicles, until we were dodging speeding scooters. Viola was annoyed by the tumult, but I think slightly pleased, too, that her point was proved.And then we arrived at the catacombs, their exterior a plain, graying building with a small plaza and parking lot. Nothing seemed suspect. Heretofore my main understanding of catacombs had been from “The Sound of Music,” in a scene where the von Trapps seek shelter from the Nazis; it was a place where dead bodies were hidden away from innocent eyes. The Palermo catacombs, however, were not made for Technicolor. We entered, and walked down to the depths of the building.Look, I haven’t seen it all, but I’ve seen a lot. And I was definitely not expecting hundreds of mummified corpses hanging in airless, limestone corridors beneath the city streets. I let out a genuine noise of surprise, a mumbled, “Oh my God.” The corpses — 1,252 in total — were all dressed in centuries-old attire. Viola, of course, was delighted by my shock. A gift from one writer friend to another: a genuinely memorable experience, one that could be breathlessly recounted over cocktails for years to come.The catacombs, first founded in the 16th century as a place to house deceased friars, were the most haunted place I’ve ever been. I sensed a specific energy in the particles in the air; there was a thickness to it, as if they were parting and allowing us in as we moved through the space, pushing us along. Practically every inch of wall space was decorated with a dead body. There was no downtime for the mind. We were fully present with death.Just when I had gotten over the shock and had grown accustomed to the atmosphere, we approached the cavallo di battaglia, a small child encased in a glass coffin.“This was what I wanted to see,” Viola said excitedly. It was Rosalia Lombardo, the last person to be embalmed in the catacombs. She had died at the age of 2 in 1920. Viola explained that because the child had been embalmed much later than the friars and the rest of the townspeople, a different method had been used on her, which helped to preserve her better. I looked closely. She looked perfectly human, but her skin was purple. There was a small bow in her hair. “That is … no joke,” I said, and held myself steady. A hundred stories blossomed in my head about a purple child sleeping in a glass case forever.There could be no more surprises left, I was certain, but oh, no, there was one more delight waiting for us. For around the corner was a nook of female forms hanging high on the wall, with words painted next to them. Viola translated: “They are virgins, they follow the lamb” — they had kept themselves pure for God. We both smirked. “Why is it the women always have to be the virgins?” I said. “Stuck sexless for eternity, that doesn’t seem fair at all.” Outside I bought a postcard of the virgins, so I could remember them forever. As if there was any chance of forgetting them.“I will take you to eat something good now,” said Viola, as we wormed our way through back streets, clotheslines overhead, passing a small pup watching the world go by in a sunny window, until we found the Pasticceria Cappello, a gleaming bakery overlooking Palermo.We sat outside and ate a slice of setteveli, a seven-layer chocolate hazelnut cake (veli means veils), reportedly invented at the pasticceria. As we ate, Viola told me the most salacious story about the Italian publishing industry — one final surprise — thus sealing our friendship forever. Surprise me and then feed me, that’s all I desire.Cars zoomed by us, precariously close, and we stared at the crooked, gritty facades of buildings in the distance. Yes, there was the chaos of a Pollock painting, but those paintings are gorgeous in their disorder. And Palermo will always be perfect to me no matter what, because that is where I got to spend time with my friend.",

Using a lethal injection drug that has been the subject of sharp constitutional debate, the state plans to execute three more men by the end of the month, before its supply of the chemical expires.Ledell Lee, who was condemned to death for the murder of Debra Reese more than 20 years ago in a Little Rock suburb, died at 11:56 p.m. Central time at the Cummins Unit, a prison in southeast Arkansas, after the reprieves he had won in federal and state courts were overturned. He received injections of three drugs: midazolam, to render him unconscious; vecuronium bromide, to halt his breathing; and potassium chloride, to stop his heart.State officials administered the lethal injection at 11:44 p.m., after Mr. Lee, who requested holy communion as his last meal, wordlessly declined to make a final statement. Sean Murphy, a reporter for The Associated Press who witnessed the execution, said Mr. Lee was not visibly uncomfortable as he was put to death. The prisoner, Mr. Murphy said, was not responsive when the authorities performed consciousness checks.An evening of appeals kept Mr. Lee, 51, alive as his death warrant neared its midnight expiration. The United States Supreme Court, as well as a federal appeals court in St. Louis, issued temporary stays of execution while they considered his legal arguments. In Little Rock, the Arkansas capital, Gov. Asa Hutchinson monitored developments at the State Capitol.At one point on Thursday night, the Supreme Court nearly halted Mr. Lee’s execution, but decided, 5 to 4, to allow the state to proceed with its plan, which had called for eight prisoners to be put to death over less than two weeks. The court’s majority — which included the newest justice, Neil M. Gorsuch — did not explain its decision, but in a dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer complained about how the state had established its execution schedule because of the approaching expiration date of Arkansas’s stock of midazolam.“In my view, that factor, when considered as a determining factor separating those who live from those who die, is close to random,” Justice Breyer wrote. “I have previously noted the arbitrariness with which executions are carried out in this country. The cases now before us reinforce that point.”Through his lawyers, who raised concerns about his intellectual capacity and the personal conduct and conflicts of some people who were involved in his trial, Mr. Lee maintained his innocence, and a state judge’s ruling threatened to block the state from using one of its execution drugs.But the courts ultimately allowed his death sentence to be carried out, making him the first prisoner in Arkansas to be executed since 2005. He had been sentenced to death in 1995 after a jury found that he had murdered Ms. Reese with a tire thumper in Jacksonville. In a 1997 ruling that upheld the conviction, the Arkansas Supreme Court said Mr. Lee had struck Ms. Reese 36 times with the small bat-shaped tool, which her husband had given her for protection.The Arkansas Parole Board said this month that Mr. Lee’s plea for executive clemency was “without merit,” and this week, the courts repeatedly rebuffed arguments to, at the least, delay his execution.“Arkansas’s decision to rush through the execution of Mr. Lee just because its supply of lethal drugs are expiring at the end of the month denied him the opportunity to conduct DNA testing that could have proven his innocence,” Nina Morrison, one of Mr. Lee’s lawyers, said in a statement. “While reasonable people can disagree on whether death is an appropriate form of punishment, no one should be executed when there is a possibility that person is innocent.”As Mr. Lee’s lawyers spent Thursday urging the courts to spare his life, the cascade of legal developments did not affect the stay of execution that another inmate, Stacey E. Johnson, received on Wednesday evening, about 24 hours before he was scheduled to be put to death.Mr. Johnson has also claimed innocence, and the State Supreme Court’s decision will allow for new forensic testing of some evidence. He was convicted of the 1993 rape and murder of Carol Heath, whose two children, according to the state, “were left alone overnight with their mother’s lifeless body.”Some of the most pitched legal clashes surrounding Arkansas’s planned executions centered on the state’s execution drugs, including midazolam, a common sedative that has been used in executions in the United States since 2013.The drug was conceived decades ago as an alternative to Valium, and it grew in popularity to become one of the world’s essential drugs, a pharmaceutical staple for procedures like colonoscopies. But as states struggled to obtain drugs for executions, they began to turn to midazolam, which has also been known as Versed, as a way to render prisoners unconscious before infusions of other drugs that cause excruciating suffering.Most executions involving midazolam have gone as planned. But a handful — in Alabama, Arizona, Ohio and Oklahoma — were criticized as botched, and some opponents argued that the drug had not sedated prisoners enough to allow them to die painless deaths. In 2015, the United States Supreme Court upheld the use of midazolam as an execution drug, but its future has remained a subject of deep dispute that has bounced among the nation’s trial and appellate courts.Arkansas was merely the latest stage for a debate that has centered on the Eighth Amendment’s protections against cruel and unusual punishment. A Federal District Court judge in Little Rock moved on Saturday to block the Arkansas executions because of her concerns about midazolam. That decision was later overturned.But the state also faced resistance in the courts because of how it purchased the second of its lethal injection drugs, vecuronium bromide. The nation’s largest pharmaceutical distributor, McKesson Corporation, accused the state of deceiving it as part of an end-run around restrictions on the sales of drugs that can be used in lethal injections.According to the company, the Arkansas Department of Correction did not disclose its intent for the drug, which the state had struggled to purchase elsewhere. The inadvertent sale, the company said, was improper, and it demanded that Arkansas return the drug.Judge Alice Gray of Circuit Court in Little Rock issued an order blocking the state from using the drug, effectively staying the executions. The state, which denied wrongdoing, appealed to the Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday.“No valid legal theory supports McKesson’s argument that a person who purchases a product must use that product in a certain way as dictated by the seller after the completion of the transaction, or must return the product on demand by the seller after the completion of the transaction,” lawyers for the state wrote in their appeal.The State Supreme Court agreed with the attorney general’s office on Thursday evening and lifted Judge Gray’s order, allowing prison officials to use the drug it bought from McKesson last summer.Mr. Lee’s execution prompted immediate criticism.“Today is a shameful day for Arkansas, which is callously rushing the judicial process by treating human beings as though they have a sell-by date,” Amnesty International said in a statement. “While other states have increasingly come to the conclusion that the capital punishment system is beyond repair, Arkansas is running in the opposite direction from progress. This assembly line of executions must stop, and this cruel and inhuman punishment should be ended once and for all.”But Arkansas officials cast the execution as a milestone.“Tonight, the lawful sentence of a jury which has been upheld by the courts through decades of challenges has been carried out,” the Arkansas attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, said in a statement. “The family of the late Debra Reese, who was brutally murdered with a tire thumper after being targeted because she was home alone, has waited more than 24 years to see justice done. I pray this lawful execution helps bring closure for the Reese family.”Speaking at the prison, Mr. Hutchinson’s spokesman, J. R. Davis, said, “It’s a moment of reflection, but at the end of the night, the right thing was done.”",

      "text" : "As the White House works to \"maximize pressure\" on North Korea, one of the ways it is hoping to turn up the heat is by deploying a high-powered anti-missile defense system to the region. During his trip to South Korea Monday, Vice President Mike Pence confirmed that the U.S. will continue with its plans to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to South Korea, despite persisting objections from China. The U.S. announced the first stage of the deployment in early March, with officials estimating it could take several months before the system is fully operational. Expand / Contract A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor is launched from a THAAD battery located on Wake Island, during Flight Test Operational (FTO)-02 Event 2a, conducted Nov. 1, 2015. (Ben Listerman ) According to the Lockheed Martin website, THAAD is \"one of the most advanced missile defense systems in the world,\" and is capable of defending against short and medium-range ballistic missiles. The system is designed to shoot down ballistic missiles at distances of more than 120 miles, and at altitudes of nearly 90 miles. According to the U.S. Military's Missile Defense Agency (MDA), THAAD also boasts a flawless record since the test program's inception in 2006, with the only \"failed\" tests having occurred when the target missile failed to launch. Critics suggest this record ignores the six failed launches of THAAD prototypes years earlier, before the systems were ordered into production. According to MDA, THAAD uses what is known as \"hit-to-kill technology,\" utilizing kinetic energy to destroy any incoming missiles mid-flight. The \"high-altitude\" aspect of the system ensures that the effects of weapons of mass destruction never reach the ground. The U.S. and South Korea announced plans for a joint deployment back in 2016, but Seoul hasn't always been receptive to the idea. In 2013, South Korea's defense minister balked at the idea of joining the U.S. missile defense system, citing costs and logistics. Related stories... North Korea tensions have Hawaii pols revisiting emergency attack plans North Korean commandos ready to kidnap Americans, says defector Pentagon announces review of nuclear posture amid North Korea tensions The deployment and operation of a single THAAD system is estimated at more than $1 billion. Washington is expected to share the costs of the latest deployment with Seoul. The U.S. and South Korea maintain that the THAAD system is only being deployed to defend against potential provocations from Pyongyang. China, however, has been outspoken in its opposition to the plan, and is said to be specifically concerned about THAAD's powerful radar system (one of the largest mobile systems in the world). A retired Chinese general was apparently so opposed that he even suggested a \"surgical hard-kill operation\" could be undertaken to destroy the system once it's in place.",

      "text" : "President Donald Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan attend a leadership lunch at the White House on March 1. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters requirejs([\"jquery\"], function($) ); Republicans’ effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act failed on Friday. It failed because legislating on health care is hard. Successfully doing so involves a lot of trade-offs and, if it’s to be meaningful, will disrupt people’s lives. Only once in modern times has a party successfully pushed through comprehensive health care reform—Barack Obama and the Democratic Party with the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Jim Newell Jim Newell is a Slate staff writer. After making repeal of that law their top legislative priority for the past seven years, Republicans now join the much longer list of failures because, during all that time, they never reached a consensus. Rather than come up with a plan the party could unite behind, and with the ACA filling the space where bipartisan consensus could be had, they splintered and entrenched. You can’t bridge that divide. (For their own political sakes, they’re lucky they didn’t.) Advertisement The tactical mistakes made along the way are all symptoms of that underlying cause. Probably most of those tactical mistakes, too, were the least worst of a slew of bad options. Leaders could have tried something else at all of these turns and found themselves failing in a different way. But let’s run through the tactical mistakes anyway. Get Slate in your inbox. It was a rather large mistake to promise to “repeal and replace Obamacare” for seven years without having any idea how to do that. It was a mistake, too, to test-run an Obamacare reconciliation bill in 2015—a bill that repealed much more of the act—for messaging purposes, when they were always too scared of such a harsh bill being signed into law. All this did was set an expectation baseline for conservatives that wouldn’t be met. It was a mistake to try to pass health care reform through reconciliation, the limits of which prevented them from legislating a complete health care vision that members could sell to their constituents, leaving them with only a half-measure pleasing no one. It was a mistake to insert a repeal of essential health benefits into the bill, and lose a wave of moderates, without first getting conservatives to commit their votes. It was a mistake for them to emphasize, from the beginning, quick passage over consensus-building as the strategy for moving this through Congress. That last one is the most excusable, since leaders recognized that there was no intra-party consensus to be reached. But if there’s no consensus, then it’s not worth trying. The tactical mistakes made along the way are all symptoms of that underlying cause. The differences that divide this party are far deeper than a disagreement on the level of some subsidy here or some regulatory ratio there. The difference is that some Republicans believe that the federal government should have a role in health care, and others don’t. Advertisement Freedom Caucus members have a cold vision of health care reform, but a coherent one. They believe that the government being involved in health care, either through regulation or subsidies, is the factor driving up prices, and undoing all of that architecture is what’s necessary to allow market forces to drive down prices. Being coherent in this way on health care policy means accepting the trade-offs that your vision entails, and Freedom Caucus members accept that this approach would leave a lot of vulnerable people in the lurch, left to the care of charities and communities. They have an odd belief that a vast majority of the American public shares this vision despite representing only a small percentage of the House of Representatives. “Moderate” Republicans and rank-and-file members don’t get off any easier. They can’t support the nefarious Obamacare, and what the free marketers want would be political suicide. But … what do they want? They didn’t answer this question, so they got what conservatives dubbed “Obamacare Lite.” Party rhetoric had made the individual mandate so toxic that, when their bill needed a similar mechanism to ward against adverse selection, they landed on a lesser idea called “continuous coverage” that would only worsen adverse selection. They had railed against the bill’s tax increases so much that, in order to pay for their repeal, they slashed and burned Medicaid spending, which a large number of their constituents rely upon. That’s not a way to muster popular support for your bill! The ACA’s income-based tax credits for people to purchase plans on the individual market, meanwhile, were so visibly evil and socialist that they resorted to … smaller age-based tax credits! And when those age-based tax credits shockingly didn’t align with people’s needs, they decided to means-test them—i.e., to include an income factor, like the ACA’s. The Affordable Care Act made the Republican Party go insane. It occupied the space of what had been the center-right vision for market-based health reform and combined it with a Medicaid expansion popular among progressives, boxing the party out from the area where consensus might be had. With that model—originally designed by a right-leaning think tank and first implemented by one of the party’s former presidential candidates—made unacceptable in order to demonize a sitting Democratic president, though, Republicans had a choice: a coherent far-right free market approach, or some amorphous blob of other. They chose an amorphous blob of other, sliced up into muddled “prongs” in accordance with Senate rules. It failed. Health care will be back again, even if what President Trump said on Friday—that it won’t be in the “near future”—is true. When it is, though, Republicans will have a choice. They can choose to do what their own congressional politics prevented them from considering—working with Democrats to improve upon the existing system—or they can hope that the pressure to act next time will be so great that it will override party factionalism. They should give it some time before answering. Top Comment The best part of all this is how they all blamed the Democrats for not getting on board. More... 1.5k Comments Join In Next up on Republicans’ agenda is comprehensive tax reform. This will be much harder now. In order to pass through reconciliation a permanent tax cut that won’t lapse after 10 years, the party needs to craft a revenue-neutral bill, which means it needed the savings the American Health Care Act would have offered by gutting insurance for 24 million people. Also: Comprehensive tax reform will be hard because it has a lot of direct stakeholders—every person and business, namely—and behind every supposedly inefficient “loophole” is an industry or 70 supporting it. President Trump has said that he looks forward to tax reform and that it will be “fun.” His advisers may want to brief him.",

      "text" : "I am a gay man in my late 20s. For a few months, I hung out with this young guy who had just finished college. We had a strong sexual connection but not much else in common, so the relationship didn’t last. I was pretty disappointed. Now I see that he is going out with a woman. I don’t know much about relationships, but I know when a guy likes having sex with other guys. And the woman he’s going out with is a friend of a friend. Should I tell her about my relationship with her new boyfriend?N. G., NEW YORKI love to put people in boxes. (It’s one of my worst qualities.) Still, they give me the illusion — albeit false — that there is order in our chaotic world; so I cling to them. But one of the things that’s impressed me most about young people, these days, is their bravery in forgoing labels (and boxes) when it comes to gender and sexuality in favor of more honest self-expression. Who knows where all this fluidity may lead? But let’s hope it’s in the general direction of greater fulfillment.Just because your young man enjoyed sex with you doesn’t mean he can’t enjoy sex with women. Abandon the notion that you are somehow “saving” the woman he is now seeing by telling her about your relationship. There is no evidence that she needs saving. To me, speaking up would smack of vindictiveness masquerading as white knighthood. Don’t be that guy.Still, I get your disappointment about the relationship not working out. But on the plus side: It points to your desire for a deeper connection, which is the first step on the road to having one. Until Mr. Right appears, I suggest an old-fashioned remedy: the breakup film. My go-to was always “Sense and Sensibility” (the Emma Thompson version, please). Honor your feelings of loss, but don’t try to scotch your ex’s new thing.For almost 40 years, I kept in touch with a college friend through letters. (Real ones — on paper, with stamps!) There was no romantic overtone to our friendship. A few years ago, he wrote that he had a terminal illness. As it progressed, I heard more from his wife, whom I didn’t know, than from him. Frequently, she wrote things I would have preferred not to know, but I think it helped her having someone to confide in. After my friend died, she wrote that he had kept my letters and she had read all of them. I was deeply offended. I waited six months, then wrote that I was upset that she had violated my privacy. I never heard from her again. Was I wrong?ANONYMOUSYour friend’s wife erred in reading your letters. You mention that there was no romantic cast to your friendship, but that doesn’t mean you didn’t confide intimately in him over the years. She should have returned the letters or destroyed them. Still, people who are grieving grasp at any and all straws within their reach. I turned my parents’ house upside down after their deaths, hunting for unspecified clues and violating their (and other people’s) privacy right and left.So, I wish you could have exercised the same kindness during the widow’s mourning that you did when she provided uncomfortable details during your friend’s final illness. Her intention was probably to connect more deeply with you as someone who cared for her husband. That doesn’t excuse her invasion of your privacy, but it does explain it in more sympathetic terms.My 32-year-old son is about to marry for the second time. His first wedding, in 2014, was a blowout destination affair for 120 guests. It cost the bride’s family and ours a ridiculous amount of money. They separated four months later. His second wedding is going to be very small (immediate family only). Is it appropriate to send a wedding announcement to close friends and family? It’s awkward because some of them don’t know he divorced. And we don’t want to look as if we’re hinting for gifts. We just don’t want people to be surprised when his new wife turns up.ANONYMOUSOf all the brilliantly funny lines uttered by the brilliantly funny Carrie Fisher, one of my favorites was her explanation of her 11-month marriage to Paul Simon: “Short people, short marriage.” It is perfectly appropriate for your son and his bride to send wedding announcements to family and friends. His first marriage was a mistake; we all make them. No need to shroud his (hopefully better-considered) second marriage in secrecy.You may receive a few calls from folks who are curious about the first wife, and they may receive a few gifts. To the first group, say, “It didn’t work out.” To the second: “Thank you.” We can’t live our lives in fear of people on the hunt for venal motives. A wedding announcement calls for gifts only to people who want to make them.",

Trump interrupted his stump speech five times to call for the hecklers' removal, at one point telling those in the crowd not to hurt the person being taken away. (Reuters) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ordered numerous hecklers to \"get out\" of the crowd during his rally in Louisville, Ky., on March 1. Trump interrupted his stump speech five times to call for the hecklers' removal, at one point telling those in the crowd not to hurt the person being taken away. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called for the removal of hecklers from his crowd at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky. Rough Cut (no reporter narration). (Reuters) The courts keep taking Donald Trump both seriously and literally. And the president's word choices are proving to be a real headache. A federal judge in Kentucky is the latest to take Trump at his word when he says something controversial. Judge David J. Hale ruled against efforts by Trump's attorneys to throw out a lawsuit accusing him of inciting violence against protesters at a March 2016 campaign rally in Louisville. At the rally, Trump repeatedly said “get 'em out of here” before, according to the protesters, they were shoved and punched by his supporters. Trump's attorneys sought to have the case dismissed on free speech grounds, arguing that he didn't intend for his supporters to use force. But Hale noted that speech inciting violence is not protected by the First Amendment and ruled that there is plenty of evidence that the protesters' injuries were a “direct and proximate result” of Trump's words. “It is plausible that Trump’s direction to ‘get 'em out of here’ advocated the use of force,” Hale wrote. “It was an order, an instruction, a command.” Trump supporters push protester at Louisville rally Embed Copy Share Play Video0:53 On March 1, 2016, then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was heard shouting, \"out, out,\" as Trump supporters and protesters clashed at his rally in Louisville, the day after his Super Tuesday victories. (Reuters) On March 1, 2016, then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was heard shouting, \"out, out,\" as Trump supporters and protesters clashed at his rally in Louisville, the day after his Super Tuesday victories. On March 1, 2016, then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was heard shouting, \"out, out,\" as Trump supporters and protesters clashed at his rally in Louisville, the day after his Super Tuesday victories. (Reuters) It's merely the latest example of Trump's team arguing that his controversial words shouldn't be taken literally. But though that argument may have held water politically during the 2016 campaign, it has since repeatedly hurt Trump's cause when his words have been at issue in legal proceedings. Just last week, a federal judge in Hawaii rejected an argument from Trump's attorneys asking that his travel ban executive order be evaluated without considering Trump's and his team's past comments about the motive behind the ban and whether it targets Muslims. Trump's campaign in 2015 proposed a blanket ban on all Muslim immigration to the United States — the news release remains on his campaign website — and the courts ruled that this rhetoric was relevant when it halted his first travel ban, despite Trump's team arguing that it wasn't a Muslim ban. In striking down the first travel ban, the courts cited Rudolph W. Giuliani's comments that suggested Trump sought to make his Muslim ban idea legally practical. “So when first announced it, he said, 'Muslim ban,'\" Giuliani said. “He called me up. He said, 'Put a commission together.

See all newsletters And in extending that order last week, the federal judge in Hawaii yet again cited the words of Trump's team — specifically, top adviser Stephen Miller, who had suggested the second ban would be, practically speaking, the same as the first. “Fundamentally, you're still going to have the same basic policy outcome for the country, but you're going to be responsive to a lot of very technical issues that were brought up by the court, and those will be addressed,” Miller said. “But, in terms of protecting the country, those basic policies are still going to be in effect.” Trump and his team will undoubtedly dismiss this latest example as yet another activist judge who is out to get him. But yet again, they are forced into the position of saying that Trump's words shouldn't be taken at face value — that he didn't mean what he actually, literally said. I've argued before that this is a completely unworkable standard when it comes to the media's coverage of Trump. It allows Trump team members to retroactively downgrade whatever they want to, while leaving the good stuff intact — essentially a Get Out of Jail Free card they can redeem anytime they want. But while Trump's supporters have certainly bought into that arrangement, the courts have yet again proved unwilling to grant the president that Get Out of Jail Free card.",

      "text" : "Elections Celebrities view Tuesday's special election as a chance to rage against the president. By Gabriel Debenedetti04/18/17 05:05 AM EDT Many of the entertainment world’s liberal, politically active celebrities have showered Democrat Jon Ossoff with cash and campaign assistance. | Getty By Mickey Edwards By Matt Latimer By Jeff Greenfield By Jerry Hendrix and Robert C. O'BrienSpoiling for a fight against a president it can’t stand, Hollywood has latched onto Tuesday’s special election for a suburban Atlanta congressional seat, eyeing the contest as a unique opportunity to tarnish Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office.Many of the entertainment world’s liberal, politically active celebrities have showered Jon Ossoff, the leading Democratic candidate in Georgia’s 6th District, with cash and campaign assistance — a harbinger, some of them say, of a sustained revolt against the president’s agenda.Story Continued Below“The end of democracy looks nigh. I think we all realize we can’t sit back, we can’t take things for granted. We can’t sit back and hope that somebody else does something, we have to do whatever we can, [so] we all gotta get woke, and that’s the mandate,” said actor John Leguizamo in an interview. “I wish there were more outspoken celebrities, athletes, artists, people with high profiles.”It’s unclear whether the influx of Hollywood support will help Ossoff in the race to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. It might even hurt his chances in the conservative-oriented district, since it helps feed into the Republican narrative about him: that he's an interloper whose support largely comes from outside the state of Georgia, let alone his district.“Hollywood is all-in on electing Ossoff,” Republican candidate Karen Handel’s campaign wrote to backers the day after actress Alyssa Milano and other celebrities campaigned in the district for him. “The Democrats have the liberal media and Hollywood celebrities to sing their praises. But we have something better: YOU. It’s critical that we come together now to support Republicans committed to fighting against the Democrats’ liberal vision for America.”The special election represents the first sustained foray against Trump by leading activists within the heavily liberal industry. But it won’t be the last with a commander in chief quick to mock them and unsparing in his assessments of their efforts to support his opponent in the presidential race he won’t put behind him. White House By Nolan D. McCaskill“It is the seat heard round the world. Everyone is watching. All the recent special elections have taken on a certain symbolism of the resistance,” Milano, who has campaigned for Democratic candidates since John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign, said in an email exchange. “We’ve now seen what a Trump presidency looks like and how his policies negatively affect every facet of our beautiful country. Supporting Ossoff is a clear message to the GOP that we don’t like the direction Trump is taking this country in, and we will continue to elect more people that will hold Trump and the entire GOP accountable for their policies. I hope we can take this momentum in the 2018 elections.”Unlike other Republican predecessors who have been the target of Hollywood’s ire, Trump has shown a willingness to respond in kind.“The so-called ‘A’ list celebrities are all winning tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!” he tweeted in December. A month later, responding to Meryl Streep’s harsh criticism in her Golden Globes speech, Trump called her “one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood” and a “Hillary flunky who lost big.\" In Georgia, Leguizamo and Milano are two in a wide array of actors and actresses who have engaged with an unusual degree of determination — politically active celebrities largely overlook House elections in favor of higher-profile contests. But Hollywood’s conspicuous backing for Ossoff, a 30-year-old filmmaker who’s looking to reach 50 percent of the vote on Tuesday to avoid a runoff, has been impossible to miss.Ossoff’s record-setting fundraising is in part fueled by tens of thousands of dollars from a wide roster of industry pros, from Kyra Sedgwick to Jane Fonda to Sam Waterston, among others. Some celebrities have used their considerable platforms to promote the campaign and advance its interests: Performers with large online followings like Debra Messing have tweeted about Ossoff repeatedly, including one on Friday alerting followers about the close of the early voting period. Comedian Chelsea Handler also encouraged Georgians to vote for Ossoff last week, though she got the date of the election wrong.

Never mind that Trump’s name isn’t on Tuesday's ballot.Asked about her involvement in special elections like the one in Georgia, actress and longtime Trump sparring partner Rosie O’Donnell, another Ossoff donor, responded via Twitter direct message, “i will say i will do all i can to oppose him and his criminal administration.” The efforts go beyond cutting checks and making public pronouncements. Actor Samuel L. Jackson rips Trump in a new radio ad aired in the district by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Your vote goes a long way toward setting things right in this country. Vote for the Democratic Party. Stop Donald Trump, the man who encourages racial and religious discrimination and sexism,” says Jackson in the ad. “Remember what happened the last time people stayed home: We got stuck with Trump. We have to channel the great vengeance and furious anger we have for this administration into votes at the ballot box.” Milano and actor Christopher Gorham, for their part, took a break from filming in Atlanta to campaign for Ossoff last month, even offering to personally drive locals to vote early. “The end of democracy looks nigh,\" said actor John Leguizamo. \"I think we all realize we can’t sit back, we can’t take things for granted.\" | GettyThe flood of activity mirrors a distinct uptick in celebrity Twitter chatter about taking down the Trump presidency — some of them have even taken to chronicling updates in the investigations into his campaign’s ties to Russia and retweeting liberal amateur investigators — a sign of their urgent opposition to the president, and also of the unusually broad public resentment of Trump. “I think it’s important to use my voice and platform to create movement and positive change in the world. Not necessarily to persuade,” said Milano, noting that she is headed to Montana to campaign for Democratic congressional candidate Rob Quist next week, \"but to educate and empower those that feel like their voice doesn’t make a difference. I want people to find what motivates them and if I can be a catalyst for the strength for them to fight for what’s right, then I feel good about what I’m doing.\"One thing hasn’t changed in the Trump era: Hollywood remains a hot spot for liberal fundraising. Potential 2020 hopefuls have recently stopped in Los Angeles for precisely that purpose, including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Asked about her involvement in special elections like the one in Georgia, Rosie O’Donnell responded via Twitter direct message, “i will say i will do all i can to oppose him and his criminal administration.” | AP PhotoBut after the industry supported Hillary Clinton so overwhelmingly over Trump in 2016 — when some of her biggest financial backers included industry magnates like ex-Disney and DreamWorks executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, \"Power Rangers\" mogul Haim Saban, and IAC executive Barry Diller — liberal celebrities will have to be content for the moment with being on the political outside looking in. It all adds up to an inflection point for many in the entertainment world, particularly after some of its biggest stars have tried to stay away from public political participation in recent months, wary of alienating vast swaths of their fan bases in the wake of such a polarizing presidential election.Clinton held behind-closed-doors fundraisers with A-listers like George Clooney and Justin Timberlake, but even her campaign-closing concerts with the likes of Jay Z, Beyoncé and Jennifer Lopez rarely included any mentions of her name at all, as the performers instead encouraged attendees to vote against Trump. “There’s a risk, and you have to be aware of that, it’s a huge risk,” said Leguizamo, pointing to initial uncertainty surrounding late-night television host Stephen Colbert’s critical commentary on Trump, before his show's ratings surge. “It’s a testament to courage and sticking to your guns. [Because] history will definitely be on our side, we all know that. You can already see the writing on the wall; the other side is just not being moral, standing up for what’s right.”Missing out on the latest scoops?

      "text" : "Two months ago, my brother died. For 20 years, we were not close. During his final illness, my wife and I visited him, though it was hard to travel to his remote home. We flew cross-country again to pay our respects at his funeral. But my sister-in-law excluded me from everything. I was refused admission to the pre-service meeting with the clergyman. I was omitted from printed obituaries (though there was room for his dog), and none of the eulogies mentioned a surviving brother. Given this disrespect, how should I behave toward his family?ANONYMOUSI am sorry for your loss. But let’s remember that the disrespect you feel came from a woman who was grieving the fresh loss of her husband and daily companion. I don’t minimize your loss; you grew up with your brother. But after 20 years of more perfunctory contact, your pain is probably more existential than focused on him. Your sister-in-law lost her mate.Your assessment may also be on the money. She may resent your failure to keep in closer touch. (She may also have been exhausted from caretaking during his illness and zonked out with grief.) But after such a long absence from his life, did you really expect a meaningful voice in creating his funeral service? Your omission from his obituary and eulogy seem like more pointed slights. Still, I direct you to the high road.In answer to your question — “how should I behave?” — I hope you choose compassion and sympathy, even if your sister-in-law was mean. My first choice is for you to call her and ask how she’s getting along. But I’ll settle for your ripping up that poison-pen letter that you, and many of us, would be composing in our heads.The woman seated next to me on an airplane asked if I would switch seats with her friend, who was in the middle seat of the row behind us, so they could sit together. I had an aisle seat, which I greatly prefer, so I said no. The woman began to yell at me and make a scene. I try to be kind; I would have switched for a parent with a small child. But how much of my convenience should I sacrifice for a stranger? Would you have switched seats?ROBINProbably not. In the micro-economy of airplanes, everyone knows that an aisle seat trumps a middle one. The unpleasant woman next to you asked you to downgrade for her sole convenience. You were not obliged to accommodate her. I too might have acceded to her request if it involved a small child or an elderly person or the prospect of sitting next to Joan Didion. But these exceptions would be ad hoc and require a level of charm in the asking.The moment the woman next to you began raging (or frankly, became even mildly unpleasant), I would have disengaged and pressed the call button for the flight attendant. Flight crew can sometimes be helpful in facilitating multipronged moves that allow friends to sit together, while respecting the economy of aisle-, middle- and window-seat values.I recently took a job, working for a person I’ve known for several years. She recruited me heavily. Now that I’ve been here for six months, I don’t think it’s a good fit. It’s a new organization, and my responsibilities keep shifting. And I’ve just received an offer that would allow me to live in the same city as my partner (we’ve been living apart since I began graduate school). But I don’t want to leave my boss in a bad spot. Your thoughts?ANONYMOUSTake the job in the city where your partner lives, assuming it’s a better fit with your skills and personality. And use all your might to negotiate the longest notice period possible (or that your boss would like from you). I admire your concern for her, but you are also responsible for developing your career and relationship with your partner. Even if you play this perfectly, your boss may still be annoyed with you. But as long as you behave with integrity, you can’t ask more of yourself.As usual, I went to Passover Seder at my older sister’s house. I love her, but she was as controlling as ever. She micromanaged everything from the minute we walked in the door. I am beginning to feel that I can no longer celebrate the freedom of the Israelites at a home where I am imprisoned by my sister’s bossy hostessing. May I stop going?JENNYWhile I applaud your personalized dramatization of Passover, I am afraid that I cannot play Moses in leading you out of your sister’s Egypt. Take a look at the first question in this column. Do you want to end up like that? Speak to your sister (gently) about loosening the reins. Offer to help with the music or some other feature she doesn’t care much about, and keep nudging until she makes a space for you.",

      "text" : "President Trump delivered an ultimatum to House Republicans on Thursday night: Vote to approve the measure to overhaul the nation’s health-care system on the House floor Friday, or reject it and the president will move on to his other legislative priorities. The president, through his aides in a closed-door meeting, signaled that the time for negotiations was over with rank-and-file Republicans who were meeting late at night on Capitol Hill to try to find common ground on the embattled package crafted by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). The move was a high-risk gamble for the president and the speaker, who have invested significant political capital in passing legislation that would replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act. For Trump, who campaigned as a skilled negotiator capable of forging a good deal on behalf of Americans, it could either vindicate or undercut one of his signature claims. If the measure fails, it would be a defeat for Trump in his first effort to help pass major legislation and it may also jeopardize other items on his wish list, including a tax overhaul and infrastructure spending. Defeat would also mean that Obamacare — something that congressional Republicans have railed against for seven years — would remain in place. “Disastrous #Obamacare has led to higher costs & fewer options. It will only continue to get worse! We must #RepealANDReplace. #PassTheBill,” Trump tweeted from his official presidential account as the meeting was wrapping up Thursday night. Sean Spicer really wants you to know: This health care thing isn't Trump's fault Embed Copy Share Play Video4:29 (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) White House press secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly asserted that President Trump has done “everything” to try to pass the GOP-proposed American Health Care Act during his briefing on March 24 at the White House. Sean Spicer really wants you to know: This health care thing isn't Trump's fault (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) It was far from clear, however, that Ryan and Trump have the votes to muscle the package through the House after several members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus refused to back it following a marathon session of negotiations Thursday with Trump and other top aides. Post-meeting, a handful of Republicans announced they would back the legislation. But a larger number said they were still opposed or had yet to make up their minds. “For seven and a half years we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law, because it’s collapsing and it’s failing families,” Ryan said. “And tomorrow we’re proceeding.” But the speaker refused to answer shouted questions from reporters after the meeting about whether he had the votes for passage. “They’re going to bring it up, pass or fail,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). In the meeting with House Republicans on Thursday night, according to Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told his former colleagues “the president needs this, the president has said he wants a vote tomorrow up or down.” “If for any reason it’s down, we’re just going to move forward with additional parts of his agenda,” Collins described Mulvaney as saying. “This is our moment in time.” View Graphic How health care amendments appease GOP moderates and hard-liners A key moment inside the session, several lawmakers said, was when Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.), a freshman lawmaker who lost both his legs in 2010 while serving as an Army bomb disposal technician in Afghanistan, rose and called on his colleagues to unite behind the bill in the same way he and his comrades fought in battle. A rowdy group of Republicans burst out of the meeting like explorers on a quest for glory. “Burn the ships,” one Republican shouted to House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (La.), invoking the command that Hernan Cortes, the Spanish conquistador, gave his men upon landing in Mexico in 1519. The message was clear, to the GOP leaders now and the Spaniards in 1519, there was no turning back. “Only way to do it,” Scalise told a packed elevator of lawmakers. Leaders continued to plead with individual lawmakers to support the measure well into Thursday night, with the House Rules Committee slated to meet early Friday morning to consider the proposed changes. Ryan got down on a knee to plead with Rep. Don Young, an 83-year-old from Alaska who is the longest-serving Republican in Congress and remains undecided. When the speaker finished with Young, he spent about 10 minutes in an animated discussion with Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), one of the bill’s most outspoken critics. At one point, the speaker took his own arms and held them up, his hands at face level, then slowly lowered them to his waist — presumably trying to demonstrate his belief that the bill will lower costs. The ongoing effort to whip the vote, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) said at one point, involved “back-patting and butt-kicking.” “Democracy’s messy,” he added. Ryan had intended to bring up his plan for a vote Thursday. But criticism — mainly from conservatives — caused that strategy to unravel after Freedom Caucus members rejected Trump’s offer to strip a key set of mandates from the nation’s current health-care law. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Trump chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon trooped up to Ryan’s office to make the case personally, warning recalcitrant conservatives that the only alternative would be to accept the ACA as the law of the land. By evening, leaders adopted the proposed change conservatives had rebuffed earlier, eliminating the law’s “essential benefits” that insurers must offer under the ACA in an effort to reduce premium costs. Those benefits include covering mental-health treatment, wellness visits, and maternity and newborn care, and states would have the option of adding them back next year. They also added one sweetener for moderates, a six-year delay in repealing a 0.9 percent additional Medicare tax on high-income Americans who earn above $200,000 if filing individually, or $250,000 if married and filing jointly. By keeping the tax in place, GOP leaders could provide an additional $15 billion to the states to help cover treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues, as well as maternity and infant care. Meanwhile, a new analysis by the Congressional Budget Office released Thursday evening showed that changes House leaders made to the bill Monday do not alter a projection that 24 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026 under the bill. In addition, the updated bill would cut the deficit by $150 billion over the next decade — nearly $200 billion less than the earlier version of the legislation. [Graphic: Health-care bill changes aimed at wooing moderates and the far-right] The changes include a couple of conservative overhauls to the Medicaid program and language directing that $85 billion be used to help Americans ages 50 to 64 obtain coverage. It was unclear how the new CBO score would affect legislative support for the bill. But it was lawmakers on the right eager to dismantle the current health-care law who remained GOP leaders’ biggest problem. “I’m still a ‘no’ on the bill,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs the Freedom Caucus. “I think it’s the president leading, and I applaud him for leading.” Some key moderates are also against the bill. Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.), who has known Trump for decades and whose Staten Island district swung heavily toward the Republican candidate, left the meeting committed to voting no. “I’ve got to think about the 744,000 people I represent,” he said. Asked about the White House’s message that killing the bill would leave no more chances for repeal, he shook his head. “I don’t believe that.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said during an appearance Thursday night on Fox News that the president remained confident the bill would pass. “At the end of the day, this is the only train leaving the station that’s going to repeal Obamacare,” he said, adding that Trump always knew winning a majority would be tough. “I think we’re going to see the same level of success” as in last year’s campaign, Spicer said. “He’s left nothing in the field.” Trump devoted much of his day to personally lobbying members. Speaking to a group of trucking executives and employees at a White House event aimed at showing how the ACA had driven up the industry’s costs, Trump joked that he did not have much time to mingle. “I’m not going to make it too long, because I have to get votes,” Trump said, sparking laughter. “I don’t want to spend too much time with you. I’m going to lose by one vote, and then I’m going to blame the truckers.” This high-wire balancing act, in which Republicans are catering to conservatives in the House with the knowledge that they still must woo moderates to get legislation to Trump’s desk, could not only reshape the nation’s health-care system but could also have uncertain electoral repercussions for the new majority. GOP leaders can afford only 21 or 22 defections, depending on how many Democrats are present Friday. But with failure not a viable option, Ryan and Trump have been working furiously to win over the large voting bloc of conservatives who control the House bill’s fate. [Conservatives want these essential benefits abolished under a new deal] Passage of the bill would represent a major political victory for both the White House and House leaders, although the ultimate fate of the legislation hinges on the Senate. There are at least a dozen skeptics of the bill among Senate Republicans, who maintain a slim 52-to-48 advantage, and many of them want to maintain some of the current law’s more generous spending components. Democrats relished the GOP’s predicament. Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who had scheduled a 4 p.m. rally against the bill, turned it into a short-term declaration of victory. “Remember, they wanted to have their repeal and replace ready when Trump was inaugurated,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.). “Now, here we are — they don’t have it, again. They’re looking for a sweet spot, and they won’t find one.” [Americans worry, cheer as Congress moves to upend the Affordable Care Act] Former president Barack Obama, for his part, issued a statement noting that more than 20 million Americans have gained coverage since he signed the law in 2010, while the rise in health-care costs has slowed. The statement came on the seventh anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act — a day that Republicans had hoped to mark by dismantling it. “So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act,” Obama said, adding that Republicans are welcome to work with Democrats to improve the law. “But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health-care system better, not worse, for hard-working Americans.

Bush was granted an AUMF to attack Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in the days after the September 11 2001 terrorist attack and then later authority to oust Saddam Hussein from Iraq. The so-called ‘war on terror’ has expanded to include Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and other countries and the focus has shifted from Al-Qaeda to the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). Some members of Congress and legal scholars contend the two original authorizations are outdated.Republicans have for years pestered Obama to revoke the previous AUMFs and come up with a new version. Obama finally complied in 2015, sending a severely limited proposal to Capitol Hill where both Democrats and Republicans shelved it saying they couldn’t come to a conclusion. Some wanted to broaden power to commit troops while others said Obama’s limited proposal went too far.Schiff argues that as deployments to Iraq and Syria increase, complicated by the use of a cruise missile strike against Syria, Congress has to “debate and vote on any new war.”“Congress must demand of this Administration and future Administrations the legal justifications for any military action, and hold them accountable for those actions.”Rampaging wild boars kill 3 #ISIS terrorists in Iraq https://t.co/TrGYmzIvLcpic.twitter.com/yoMycvZXuL— RT (@RT_com) April 26, 2017House Republicans introduced their own measure in March, with a companion bill in the Senate.The measure, introduced by House Representative Jim Banks (R-Indiana) would include the fight against IS in the resolution. The Senate version was introduced by Senator Todd Young (R-Indiana).Banks’ proposal would allow the US to detain members of terrorist groups. It would also require President Trump to submit to Congress a comprehensive plan to defeat IS within 30 days of signing the bill into law – a requirement that mirrors an order the president issued at the end of January, tasking military and security leaders to create a plan to defeat IS within 30 days.Without Republican and Democratic co-sponsors, the measures have little chance of passing, but if they do pick up support, it could pave the way for future legislation.Schiff and Senator Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) in a joint letter to President Trump this week, also sought the basis of his legal authority for the missile strike on Syria’s Shayrat Air Base earlier this month.“While the administration provided a notification to Congress, consistent with the requirements for the War Powers Resolution, that notice simply asserted that the strike was ordered… and you might order ‘additional action, as necessary and appropriate, to further important national interests,’” wrote Schiff and Kaine. Read more ISIS leaders ‘negotiate merger’ with other terrorist groups – FSB head The lawmakers said the assertion didn’t provide Congress with the information it needed to “exercise our constitutional responsibilities,” and the justification for bombing shouldn’t be an afterthought.They argued the lack of justification does not “provide comfort to a public that fears deeper involvement in a horrific civil war at a time with the US troop presence in the region is already increasing.”Schiff and Kaine stressed this was all the more important because of increasing tensions in the North Korean Peninsula.Even without a new AUMF, the US military has been expanding its fight against IS.In March it was reported the Pentagon was planning on deploying 1,000 more troops to Syria to help in the offensive against the IS stronghold of Raqqa.Officially, there are 503 US troops in Syria, according to the Pentagon, largely Special Forces operators who have been training local opposition troops.",

      "text" : "US President Donald Trump smiles during a national teacher of the year event in the Oval Office of the White House April 26, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo credit: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images) President Trump made good on his pledge to tackle tax reform. On Wednesday, he introduced a sweeping overhaul of the Tax Code. Despite the broad and ambitious scope of the proposal, it was short on details, including how much the plan would cost. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has brushed aside concerns about the cost, claiming that the resulting economic growth would make the plan pay for itself.\nTrump has characterized the plan as \"one of the biggest tax cuts in American history.\" The details of the plan have not been finalized with the White House releasing a summary, rather than a detailed proposal. You can read the White House's statement here and the one-page summary here.\nWith that, here are some of the likely winners and losers under the plan:\nWinners C Corporations. Most people have heard about the double-taxation structure for corporations. Corporations tends to mean C corporations (named after the subchapter of the Tax Code that controls them). With a C corporation, companies pay tax on profits at the corporate level and individuals pay when money is distributed as dividends or salaries. Trump’s proposal would lower the corporate tax rate - the tax at the entity level - to 15%. Pass through companies. Not all companies are C corporations. Businesses can use other structures, like limited liability companies (LLCs) or S corporations (again, named after the subchapter of the Tax Code that controls them), to pass-through income to the owners, escaping tax at the company level. Those owners are taxed at individual rates, which can be as high as 39.6%. Trump's proposal would allow those owners to be taxed at 15% instead of individual tax rates. Multinational companies. Under our current system, U.S. companies must pay tax on all profits, no matter where they are earned - although clearly, there is a lot of wiggle here (see immediately below). Trump's proposal calls for a switch to a territorial system for businesses which means that U.S. companies would only pay tax on profits earned in the U.S. Companies stashing money overseas. The White House has proposed a tax \"holiday\" to encourage companies stockpiling cash offshore to repatriate those funds at a reduced tax rate. The White House hasn't signaled how low rates could go but say that it must dip enough to spur investment and hiring. A study by the Center on Budget and Policy Procedures, however, showed that while $315 billion in earnings were repatriated under a 2004 tax holiday, most companies used the money to pay dividends or buy back stock. Pfizer, which repatriated the most money under the 2004 holiday laid off 3,500 employees just after the holiday and closed factories. Other companies that took advantage of the holiday and subsequently laid off employees include Merck, Hewlett-Packard, Ford, and Pepsi. Concerns over that track record meant that a similar effort for a tax holiday in 2011 failed. DIYers and tax software companies. Taxpayers typically complain that the Tax Code is too complicated: they want it to be more simple. Trump's proposal would nearly double the standard deduction and eliminate most itemized deductions. The idea is that fewer taxpayers would need to itemize their tax returns, making it easier to complete a tax return - and they're likely to turn to software to do it. About 1 in 3 taxpayers itemize: in 2014, the last year for which complete tax data is available, out of 148,606,579 taxpayers, 43,965,083 taxpayers itemized their deductions (report downloads as a pdf). Tax lawyers and accountants. While Trump's proposal might make tax compliance easier (see above), the changes in rates mean that there may be new ways to characterize income to take advantage of the new rate (trust me, my mind is already churning through scenarios). An alternative title to Trump's plan might be the \"Full Employment Act For Tax Planners.\" High income taxpayers. One of the most dreaded taxes is the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The AMT is a secondary tax put in place to prevent the wealthy from artificially reducing their tax bill through the use of tax preference items. Trump's proposal would eliminate the AMT, reduce the top rate on individual income tax (to 35%), and eliminate the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT), an extra 3.8% tax on certain investment income for high-income taxpayers. High net worth families. Trump's plan would eliminate the federal estate tax. Currently, an individual can leave $5.49 million to heirs and pay no federal estate or gift tax while a married couple will be able to shield $10.98 million from federal estate and gift taxes. Losers High tax state taxpayers. Trump's tax plan would eliminate the federal deduction for state and local income tax. If you live in a high-tax state, like New Jersey, you could lose out if the bump in the standard deduction isn't enough to make up for the tax bite. In 2014, 32,456,158 taxpayers claimed a deduction for state and local income taxes. Housing industry. Trump's tax plan keeps the home mortgage interest deduction in place. But by doubling the standard deduction and removing other itemized deductions, chances are that taxpayers won't be incentivized to buy (or significantly improve) homes. It's also unclear whether the deduction for real estate taxes would remain (it was not singled out as a deduction which would be saved): in 2014, 37,320,541 taxpayers claimed a deduction for real estate taxes. The National Association of Realtors has already labeled the proposal a \"non-starter.\" (For more on the impact on the housing industry, see this article.) Charities. Trump's tax plan also keeps the charitable deduction. However, the same concerns apply to charities as do the housing industry: by doubling the standard deduction and removing other itemized deductions, there may be fewer financial reasons for the middle class to donate to charity. (For more on the impact on charities, see this article.) Workers who pay their own expenses. The plan proposes to shutter almost all of the itemized deductions except, as noted, those for home mortgage interest and charitable giving. That should mean that unreimbursed employee expenses, including union dues, mileage, the home office deduction, will be at risk for elimination. Tax preparers. Planners may survive, but professional tax preparers may get a double whammy under the Trump proposal: not only does the plan make it more likely that you might do your own taxes, it would also eliminate the deduction for tax preparation fees. In 2014, 20,802,143 taxpayers took advantage of this deduction. Trump famously claimed during his campaign that \"I want to put H&R Block out of business. I want to put 'em out of business.\" Wage earners. Forbes editor Janet Novack jokes that we're all going to become self-employed now - but she has a point. Eliminating unreimbursed job expenses while offering lower tax rates for owners of pass-through companies and the self-employed creates huge incentives to re-characterize your income. It also provides a disincentive to simply collect a paycheck from a company. Self-insured. If you are self-employed and pay for your own health insurance, your health insurance deduction should be safe (if above-the-line deductions, meaning those deductions you can claim even if you don't itemize, survive). Ditto for those folks who have their health care insurance paid by their employer. However, if you pay your own way and claim those costs on your Schedule A, it appears under Trump's plan that you will lose the deduction (Mnuchin said Trump hopes to \"eliminate on the personal side all tax deductions other than mortgage interest and charitable deductions\"). Sick or unhealthy taxpayers. Currently, you can claim medical expenses that you pay out of pocket. Again, if Mnuchin's statements hold true regarding the elimination of deductions other than home mortgage interest and charitable deduction, then the health care deduction would be at risk. Those who take advantage of the deduction typically have a high level of medical expenses compared to income: you can only deduct those expenses which exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income (AGI), which is a pretty high bar. In 2014, just 8,606,481 taxpayers claimed the medical expense deduction. National Debt. The Trump plan doesn't yet have a price tag. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reports that the \"base-case estimate is $5.5 trillion in revenue loss over a decade.\" The CRFB warns that the lack of offsets could result in a large increase in the federal debt: if we have to borrow more money, the Senate will have to find more than a simple majority to push legislation through. Currently, our national debt is higher than at any time in history outside of World War II. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI). On Wednesday, Speaker Ryan called Trump’s proposal \"a critical step forward in this effort.\" However, some on the Hill have suggested that Ryan is not happy with the plan because there are no offsets to pay for cuts. Specifically, Trump's proposal did not include some of the issues that Ryan has been working on, including the border adjustment tax.

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — An airstrike by the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State killed 18 Syrian fighters allied with the United States, the military said on Thursday.The strike, on Tuesday in Tabqah, Syria, was the third time in a month that American-led airstrikes may have killed civilians or allies, and it comes even as the Pentagon is investigating two previous airstrikes that killed or wounded scores of civilians in a mosque complex in Syria and in a building in the west of Mosul, Iraq.Tuesday’s strike was requested by coalition allies who were on the ground near Tabqah, the United States Central Command, which oversees combat operations in the Middle East, said in a statement. The fighters had called in the airstrikes and “identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position,” it said, using another name for the Islamic State.The Central Command statement said that the target location turned out to be a “fighting position” for the Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been fighting the Islamic State alongside the United States.It was unclear whether the strike came from an American warplane or one from the other coalition partners.“The coalition’s deepest condolences go out to the members of the S.D.F. and their families,” Central Command said in the statement, calling the episode “tragic.” Military officials said the cause is being investigated.As the American-led military campaigns against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have intensified in recent months, so, too, have reports of civilian casualties and, now, friendly fire.Military officials say that is to be expected as Iraqi forces try to retake Mosul in what is seen as the last big urban hurdle to defeating the extremist Sunni militant group in Iraq, and while forces allied with the United States are moving in on the group’s de facto capital of Raqqa, in Syria.President Trump has indicated that unlike President Barack Obama, who had his White House scrutinize many military operations, he will leave more operational decision-making to the Pentagon and to American commanders in the field.That move has been welcomed by many in the military, who often expressed frustration at what they saw as a cumbersome decision-making process in Mr. Obama’s White House. But it has raised questions about whether Mr. Trump is exercising sufficient oversight.",

      "text" : "ROSWELL, Ga. — Jon Ossoff, a Democrat making his first bid for elective office, narrowly missed winning outright in a heavily conservative House district in Georgia on Wednesday, throwing a scare into Republicans in a special congressional election that was seen as an early referendum on President Trump.Mr. Ossoff received 48.1 percent of the vote, just short of the 50 percent threshold needed to win the seat, and he will face Karen Handel, the top Republican vote-getter, in a June runoff.A documentary filmmaker and former congressional staff member, Mr. Ossoff, 30, had hoped to avert a runoff in the Sixth District, a Republican-dominated section of the Atlanta suburbs that had been represented by Tom Price, who is now Mr. Trump’s health and human services secretary. But despite his financial advantage — Mr. Ossoff had raised $8.3 million, more than quadruple that of the next-closest candidate — and a highly energized liberal base, a majority was just out of reach in a district that has not sent a Democrat to Congress since the Carter administration.Mr. Ossoff released a statement early Wednesday after the race was called.“This is already a remarkable victory,” he said. “We defied the odds, shattered expectations, and now are ready to fight on and win in June.”Mr. Ossoff’s strong showing will ensure that national Democrats continue to compete here and will increase pressure on the party to contest a special House election next month in Montana that it has so far ignored. Combined with Democrats’ better-than-expected performance in a special House election in Kansas last week, the Georgia result will be an immediate boon to Democratic groups, lifting their fund-raising and bolstering candidate recruitment efforts, while sobering Republicans who are assessing whether to run in Mr. Trump’s first midterm election. Already, Republican candidates and outside groups have had to spend over $7 million against Democrats in a series of deeply conservative districts.Early Wednesday, Mr. Trump, who had posted a number of Twitter messages on the contest in the last few days, claimed a victory for Republicans before the race was called.As Mr. Ossoff faces Ms. Handel in a head-to-head race on June 20, it is unclear whether he will be able to sustain the success he enjoyed on Tuesday, in an 18-person field. Ms. Handel, who received just under 20 percent of the vote, is a former Georgia secretary of state and is viewed as an establishment-friendly Republican. While she has struggled in her two most recent campaigns, losing primaries for governor and senator, she will receive the full support of a party that dominates Georgia politics, as well as nearly unlimited resources from Washington Republicans, in the runoff.Ms. Handel, 55, has portrayed herself as a Trump supporter, though she was less fervent in her backing for him than were the other Republican candidates in the race, who adopted Mr. Trump’s catchphrases and style in an attempt to stand out.The intense Republican competition and liberal enthusiasm lifted Democratic hopes that they could snatch a surprise victory.“We are certainly going for an outright win here today,” Mr. Ossoff told CNN on Tuesday before the polls closed.Much as they did in last week’s race in Kansas, Democrats initially got their hopes up after promising early-vote returns were posted soon after polls closed. But as the Election Day results trickled in, it became clear that those early and absentee ballots, reflecting their fired-up base, would not be sufficient to match the Republicans’ structural advantage in the district.On Tuesday night, hundreds of Ossoff supporters crammed into a ballroom at a Crowne Plaza hotel. Cries of delight erupted as early returns flashed on big television screens. But many attendees were cautiously optimistic, with an emphasis on caution.Janice Owens, 60, a project manager who had been knocking on doors and making calls for Mr. Ossoff, said she and others would not feel the effort was wasted if Mr. Ossoff failed to avert a runoff.“I don’t think anybody thinks it’s for naught,” she said. “Because we’re not giving up.” If anything, the Ossoff campaign showed how Democrats had been successful, even in this Republican-friendly chunk of suburbia, in converting an enthusiastic but inchoate anti-Trump movement into a real political force.Ms. Handel took the stage at a lightly attended victory party of her own shortly after 11 p.m. to claim her spot in the runoff — and urge Republicans to unify to stop Democrats’ effort to “steal a seat.”Ms. Handel, battling a few bouts of feedback from a microphone, invoked the “great legacy” of a district that she noted had produced the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senator Johnny Isakson and Mr. Price.But she made no mention of Mr. Trump. Ms. Handel dismissed her opponent as a “young man” beholden to national liberals and vowed to “kick a little Ossoff.”The contest here effectively represented the first performance review at the ballot box for Mr. Trump and the Republican Congress among the sort of upscale voters who were left without a political home last fall. Mr. Price’s former district is the most highly educated Republican-controlled district in the country. And while the president won here in Atlanta’s booming northern suburbs, he did so by just a single point four years after Mitt Romney romped to a 23-point victory.For all of the attention lavished on the working class — Rust Belt voters who flocked to Mr. Trump’s campaign — voters who have flourished in the 21st-century economy will prove more crucial when it comes to the fight for control of Congress next year. If Democrats are to have a chance at recapturing the House, they will have to win over the dominant constituency here: suburbanites who only grudgingly cast a presidential ballot in November and have no deep affinity for either Mr. Trump or the Democrats.None of the major Republican contenders pointedly distanced themselves from the president — they did not dare anger the partisans most likely to vote in a spring special election — but most of them did not make him central to their appeals, either.With Republican Party officials worried that Democratic enthusiasm might be enough for Mr. Ossoff to get more than 50 percent of the vote and win the seat outright, though, Mr. Trump eventually did weigh in on the contest. He recorded a robocall delivered Monday to Republican voters in the district, warning that Mr. Ossoff would “raise your taxes, destroy your health care and flood our country with illegal immigrants.” And he posted on Twitter a series of messages similarly criticizing Mr. Ossoff while prodding Republicans to “force runoff.”Mr. Ossoff walked a careful line when it came to Mr. Trump. He opened his bid with donor-tailored appeals to “Make Trump Furious” and continued similar targeted advertising throughout his campaign. But he also sought to cast himself as a consensus-oriented moderate focused on the district, dismissing Mr. Trump’s late intervention as so much noise from Washington.Sensing an opportunity to deliver an early blow to Mr. Trump, and nudged ahead by an animated base hungry to register its fury, Democrats aggressively competed to win outright on Tuesday and avert a more directly partisan runoff. In addition to Mr. Ossoff’s astounding $8.3 million haul through the end of March, the House Democratic campaign arm poured money and staff into the district.Republicans were as fractured as Democrats were unified, with political veterans such as Ms. Handel on the ballot as well as newcomers who saw an opportunity at a moment when the party seemed to be in flux.The Republican field was divided over the failed bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it treated the issue delicately in what amounted to a concession that what was once the safest stance in a Republican primary — demanding full repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care law — was not so clear-cut any longer.In an illustration of how nationalized the race became, 95 percent of Mr. Ossoff’s fund-raising haul was from out of state, and even more was from outside the district, where the candidate himself does not reside (though he grew up there).Republicans blistered him on this score and much else, a kitchen-sink campaign that totaled $5 million yet also stirred muttering within the party about why there had not been a more coherent approach to a district they knew would be competitive, given Mr. Trump’s weakness here. But the unrelenting Republican assault eventually paid off, raising Mr. Ossoff’s negative ratings and nudging conservative voters to show up for an unusual spring election.",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-sets-sights-on-augmented-reality-1492536654To Mark Zuckerberg, Pokémon Go wasn’t just a fad from last summer. It was a sign that augmented-reality technology was coming more quickly than he expected.The mobile game was among the trends that helped the Facebook Inc. FB -0.33% chief executive realize that augmented reality might catch on sooner than rival virtual reality technology -- where Mr. Zuckerberg had placed his biggest bet. On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg shifted his view toward augmented reality, which mixes the physical and digital worlds, when he announced at Facebook’s annual F8 developers’ conference that Facebook would make its augmented-reality tools available to third-parties to create custom masks, filters and other effects. Early partners include Nike Inc., Electronic Arts Inc. and Warner Bros.“I think people look at this stuff and think: OK, that’s kind of fun, kind of primitive, this is just what kids like doing today,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview last week at Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. “But we look at that and we see the beginning of a platform.”Facebook’s focus on augmented reality at F8, which takes place Tuesday and Wednesday in San Jose, Calif., is a major new salvo in Facebook’s competition with Snap Inc.’s Snapchat. Facebook’s smaller rival popularized simple augmented reality tools, such as Snapchat filters, which overlay masks or dog noses on users’ faces. Also on Tuesday, Snapchat introduced a new feature to capture backgrounds. For now, augmented-reality technology remains nascent, Mr. Zuckerberg said. But he predicts that eventually it will open the door to a broader set of services and perhaps one day replace household objects like a television set with $1 apps.In Mr. Zuckerberg’s view, Facebook’s nearly two billion users favor more immersive mediums like photos and videos, and will increasingly use their cameras to interact with the world. Last month, Facebook tried to make the camera more central to the use of the app by adding a “swipe right” move to open the camera. But the embrace of more visual forms of communication comes with challenges. Facebook is already struggling to moderate objectionable videos posted on its site. The broadcasting on Facebook of a murder in Cleveland on Sunday became a national issue that Mr. Zuckerberg addressed onstage at F8. “We have a lot of work and we’ll do all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. Steve Stephens, the alleged killer who posted the videos, shot himself earlier Tuesday after a brief pursuit from police.Facebook’s other apps, including its two chat apps Messenger and WhatsApp and the photo-sharing app Instagram, are going through a similar shift toward more visual communication. All of Facebook’s apps feature a “stories” tool, created by Snapchat, that allows users to post images and videos that vanish in 24 hours.Facebook had seized on virtual reality to vault the company into the next generation of technological interaction. By buying virtual-reality company Oculus VR for more than $2 billion in 2014, Facebook was seen to have placed its chips on virtual reality, in which users are fully immersed in a fabricated world, over augmented reality. Mr. Zuckerberg said virtual reality would become the next major computing platform after mobile devices.But virtual reality has struggled to take off, at Facebook and at other companies developing the technology. Oculus built a headset to experience virtual reality, but it faced production delays and was expensive to purchase. In addition, no game or application has caught on as a must-have that would make a broader audience buy into virtual reality.Pokémon Go did that for augmented reality last July. Mr. Zuckerberg declared himself a fan of the game that displayed characters on a sidewalk through the smartphone screen. Over the past year, augmented reality has figured more prominently in Mr. Zuckerberg’s vision of how people will communicate, shop and consume information in the future. Mr. Zuckerberg said both technologies would serve as the next computing platform over the next 10 to 15 years. Oculus technology and research in areas like motion tracking helped strengthen its foundation in augmented reality, he said. “I think VR and AR are two sides of a coin,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in the interview. Last year, Mr. Zuckerberg said his biggest takeaway from Pokémon’s success was that most people would be introduced to augmented reality through their phones, not through glasses, as he previously expected. That made the barrier to using augmented reality much lower than virtual reality, which leans heavily on costly hardware. (Facebook is still developing augmented-reality glasses.) “If you look at how we use our screens today, about half the time is TV—so pretty immersive—and then half the time is phones and computers—so more just like transitory, utility,” he added. “Even in that long-term case, maybe half of the use case will be virtual reality.” Facebook’s focus on virtual reality means it has devoted much less time and investment to augmented reality. It made a minor acquisition last year of a startup called MSQRD, which also creates face filters. Now, in augmented reality, Facebook faces competition from companies like Snap; Microsoft Corp.; which is developing an augmented-reality headset called HoloLens; and Magic Leap Inc., an augmented-reality startup backed by Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Snap’s new augmented reality feature could allow it to obtain more data on products users have around them—potentially valuable to advertisers. The feature could have the capability of spotting brands in a user’s surroundings. Mr. Zuckerberg also sees the Facebook app offering a much broader range of services through augmented reality, such as displaying purchase information for a bottle of wine or a tour of the Colosseum, along with illustrations of what it would have looked like during the Roman empire. Augmented reality could open the door to new styles of art, Mr. Zuckerberg says.Facebook could even combine its augmented-reality tools with its facial-recognition technology to help users who need to be reminded of someone’s name, Mr. Zuckerberg said. But that raises thorny privacy issues. “There are many, many things to figure out,” Mr. Zuckerberg said.Separately at F8, Messenger unveiled several new features and revamped its chatbots to allow for services that didn’t require conversation, like a Spotify “chat extension” that just helps users share songs.

      "text" : "Self-driving still seems to be a ways off from active public use on regular roads, but once it arrives, it could ramp very quickly, according to a new study by the Boston Consulting Group. The study found that by 2030, up to a quarter of driving miles in the U.S. could be handled by self-driving electric vehicles operating in shared service fleets in cities, due mostly to considerable cost savings for urban drivers.The big change BCG sees is a result of the rise in interest in autonomous technologies, paired with the increased electrification of vehicles. There’s also more pressure on cities to come up with alternate transportation solutions that address increasing congestion. All of that added together could drive reduction in costs by up to 60 percent for drivers who opt into using shared self-driving services vs. owning and operating their own cars.\nThis won’t result in a precipitous drop in the car sales market, however, according to BCG. Total demand for cars will remain high, but the shift of who owns them and how they’re used will change dramatically, if the report’s findings prove correct – particularly in large cities where the fleets could have ramifications including decreased traffic congestion, but also decreased ridership, which the research firm says could lead to regulated limits on how many self-driving taxi services can operate in a given area.\nUltimately, the dramatic uptake is down to cold, hard cash: BCG says that shared fleets might be able to effectively double discretionary income for the average city-dweller over the course of a year, and we all know fun money is a powerful motivator.\nStudies don’t always line up with reality, of course, but it’s clear automakers are investing in and planning for a future in which shared fleet services play a key role in their city-based business. Timelines can easily change, but this looks like a reasonable picture of our eventual future. Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-son-in-law-jared-kushner-agrees-to-meet-senate-panel-in-russia-probe-1490624814WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met during the White House transition with the head of a state-run Russian bank that is on a U.S. sanctions list, administration officials said.Mr. Kushner has been asked to discuss his contact with the bank executive with a Senate committee probing Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to White House and congressional officials. The committee also wants Mr. Kushner to discuss another meeting he had with the Russian ambassador during the same period. Mr. Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump’s elder daughter, Ivanka, and holds the title of senior adviser to the president, has agreed to speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee, the first White House official to do so. Capital Journal is WSJ.com’s home for politics, policy and national security news.Officials said Mr. Kushner met in December with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S., and Michael Flynn, who resigned in February as national security adviser after it was disclosed he misled officials about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.Mr. Kushner subsequently had aide Avraham Berkowitz handle another meeting requested by Mr. Kislyak, during which the ambassador sought to arrange a meeting between Mr. Kushner and Sergei Gorkov, the head of Vneshekonombank, or VEB, the officials said. Mr. Kushner’s meeting with Mr. Gorkov took place in December at a location other than Trump Tower, a senior administration official said.In 2014 the U.S. slapped sanctions on the Russian development bank, naming entities and individuals operating in Russia’s economy following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea. The Treasury Department sanctions prohibit specified financial contacts with the bank and others on the list.VEB said its leadership met with representatives from top world financial institutions in Europe, Asia and the U.S. throughout 2016 while developing a new strategy for the bank. “The meetings took place in the format of a roadshow for Vneshekonombank’s 2021 strategy with representatives from major banks and business circles in the U.S.,” including the head of Kushner Cos., Mr. Kushner’s real-estate firm, the bank said.A senior administration official said Mr. Kushner didn’t know the bank was under sanction and “wasn’t there to discuss business.” The administration official said Mr. Kushner met Mr. Gorkov at Mr. Kislyak’s recommendation, and that the two men may have discussed the topics VEB described. A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington didn’t respond to a request for comment.Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) and Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D., Va.) said they expected Mr. Kushner “to be able to provide answers to key questions that have arisen in our inquiry.” The committee leaders said the timing of the testimony had yet to be determined.White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Mr. Kushner’s meetings were part of his role during the transition as the “primary point of contact with foreign government officials.” He said Mr. Kushner had volunteered to testify.The Senate and House intelligence committees are running separate but parallel investigations into the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that Russia ran a campaign designed to help Mr. Trump win last year’s presidential election. The New York Times reported Monday that Mr. Kushner, a former newspaper publisher and real-estate developer, would meet with the Senate panel.The Russian campaign, according to U.S. intelligence officials, included cyberattacks on the email accounts of senior Democrats and a propaganda effort aimed at demonizing Mr. Trump’s opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. The Russian government denies the allegation. The White House said the Trump campaign didn’t collude with any alleged Russian meddling.The congressional panels have sought testimony from a string of former Trump aides and associates in connection with the investigation. On Friday, House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes said Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort would appear before his panel.Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, said he “would eagerly welcome the chance to speak with the committee to help finally set the record straight.” Roger Stone, a GOP operative who has advised Mr. Trump, also said he was willing to appear before the committee.VEB, which has been used to finance political projects such as the Sochi Olympics development, recently became embroiled in a spy scandal, with federal prosecutors accusing one of its top New York executives of operating as a spy under nonofficial cover.The No. 2 employee at VEB’s New York office, Evgeny Buryakov, pleaded guilty in March 2016 to conspiring to act in the U.S. as a Russian agent without providing prior notice to the U.S. attorney general. Federal prosecutors had accused him and two others of spying in New York for the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence agency. Mr. Buryakov was sentenced in May to 30 months in U.S. prison for conspiring to work for Russian intelligence. Mr. Gorkov, the bank’s chairman, graduated in 1994 from the Academy of the Federal Security Service of Russia, a school for intelligence officials. He later worked for the now-defunct Russian oil giant Yukos and state-controlled Sberbank before taking the top job at VEB.The plunge in oil prices and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis have pushed the bank into financial trouble, forcing the Russian government to undertake a bailout.Meanwhile, the administration said Monday that Mr. Kushner will oversee a new White House office tasked with replicating private-sector efficiency inside the federal government.

      "text" : "(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) THE MORNING PLUM: President Trump has reversed himself on a lot of campaign promises lately, and some have rushed to credit him with learning on the job. While one hopes he is capable of this, his reversals also reflect the less admirable factor that his original campaign agenda was mostly fraudulent — and is now colliding violently with reality. One excellent illustration of this is Trump’s vow to pull the United States out of the Paris climate deal. And that’s why it’s good news that Trump is now seriously considering remaining in the accord, now that some of his most senior advisers are apprising him of the folly of withdrawing from it. opinions plum-line Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters The Associated Press and the New York Times report that Trump’s top advisers will huddle Tuesday to decide what to recommend to the president about the United States’ path forward. The Times notes that there is a divide among them that breaks down this way: On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to “cancel” the climate deal, and his most politically conservative advisers, including his senior strategist Stephen K. Bannon, have pushed him to follow through. But Mr. Bannon’s influence has waned in recent weeks, while authority has risen for Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who advocate staying in the accord. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has also spoken in favor of “keeping a seat at the table” in the climate pact, and in recent days, major corporations have stepped forward to embrace that position. With Kushner and Ivanka Trump on the ascendant, even as the Bannon wing loses clout, the Times notes that “the side pressing the president to remain in the deal enters the pivotal meeting with the upper hand.” What's next for the Paris Agreement? Embed Copy Share Play Video1:41 The Paris Agreement entered into force on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016. The Post's Chris Mooney explains where we go from here. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) The Paris Agreement entered into force on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016. The Post's Chris Mooney explains where we go from here. The Paris Agreement entered into force on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016. The Post's Chris Mooney explains where we go from here. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) If they prevail, it could have important long-term consequences for the battle against climate change. It is true that Trump is already making it a lot harder for us to meet our commitments as part of the deal, by moving to reverse former president Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which sets goals for states to reduce carbon emissions and is key to whether we hit our reduction targets. [Why slashing the NIH budget is indefensible] But for various reasons, unwinding that plan could prove hard to do and could take a long time. What’s more, even if Trump does make headway on that front, there may still be merits to remaining in the Paris deal even if we fall short of our pledges. “Staying in the Paris accord signals to the world that the long-term policy of the United States is to control greenhouse gases,” Richard Revesz, an environmental law expert who wrote a useful book about the climate wars, told me this morning. “The U.S. gets large benefits from the greenhouse gas reductions occurring outside our borders, and the actions of the U.S. are likely to have an impact on the actions of other countries. Withdrawing from it is likely to lead some other countries to relax their own commitments, to the detriment of the United States.” Remaining in the deal would signal that the United States may well continue to play a leadership role in sustaining international efforts to battle global warming — even if it has to wait until after the current president leaves office. “By staying in, the United States would have a seat at the table from which the [next] administration could communicate right away the new commitment of the United States, and then begin taking domestic actions to meet this commitment,” Revesz says. Of course, there are other actions the United States could take — short of pulling out entirely — that could be damaging. One alternative being weighed would keep the U.S. in the accord while replacing our current commitment — reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 level by 2025 — with far less ambitious goals. Still, it’s telling that Tillerson wants to remain in the deal, because that represents a recognition that reneging on this particular international commitment could have detrimental diplomatic consequences. “Imagine trying to get other leaders’ cooperation on the next international crisis, or any Trump priority, after you stuck a finger in everyone’s eye,” David Doniger, director of the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. In this sense, staying in the Paris accord could deal another blow to the Bannon wing’s “economic nationalist” project. This holds that international engagement is primarily a cause for deep suspicion — it’s a threat to American sovereignty that serves only the interests of allied cosmopolitan international elites who enrich themselves while disdaining and disenfranchising local working peoples. There is little room in this vision for the idea that constructive global engagement can, if done properly, serve America’s long-term interests, as part of a system of mutually advantageous compromises. While our approach to trade should be improved on behalf of American workers, the Bannonite vision is mostly simplistic demagoguery. Plenty of things are objectionable in the worldview of the “globalists” inside the White House, but staying in the Paris deal is not one of them — and represents one way in which they are right and the Bannon wing is wrong. It would reaffirm a reality-based view of the merits of international cooperation and diplomacy. [Trump’s cake and golf presidency] One last nuance is worth appreciating. It is often stipulated that Trump’s recent reversals show he is abandoning Bannonite economic nationalism (never mind that Trump is retaining the nativism and xenophobia) and embracing orthodox conservative governance. But most conventional Republicans disdain climate change regulations, and many are climate change skeptics or outright deniers. Remember, pretty much all the other GOP presidential candidates fit this mold. And so, if the administration does remain in the Paris accord, it would represent a partial victory over some of the worst elements of both Trumpism and GOP orthodoxy. ************************************************************************ * TAX REFORM IS ON VERGE OF DEATH: The New York Times reports that Trump’s dream of a sweeping overhaul of the tax code may not survive, due to internal disagreements among Republicans, and crucially, Trump’s failure to release his tax returns: A growing roster of more than a dozen Republican lawmakers now say Mr. Trump should release them … The Trump administration’s tax plan, promised in February, has yet to materialize; a House Republican plan has bogged down, taking as much fire from conservatives as liberals … lawmakers do not want to pass an overhaul of the tax code that unwittingly enriches the commander in chief and his progeny. As ethics expert Norm Eisen predicted to this blog, if Trump wants tax reform — and he really needs a big accomplishment — he may have to make serious concessions on transparency. * WHITE HOUSE WILL CLOSELY WATCH TODAY’S GEORGIA ELECTION: Axios reports that the White House is taking a keen interest in today’s special election in Georgia, in which Democrat Jon Ossoff is likely to win easily but may not reach 50 percent to avoid a runoff: Why Trump cares: Whether he likes it or not, the media will portray this election as an early verdict on his presidency. The year’s first special election, in Kansas’ usually reliable deep-red 4th district, was way closer than it should’ve been. A loss in Georgia would further weaken Trump and make his legislative agenda — which relies on him holding his popularity like a knife over recalcitrant Republicans — a fair bit tougher. And as we’ve seen, Trump’s “popularity” already has totally cowed congressional Republicans into doing his bidding. (Not. And today could make it worse.) * WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN GEORGIA: Nate Cohn notes that turnout will be very unpredictable, as this is a special election, but the early voting turnout should boost Democrats’ confidence more generally: Democratic turnout [in the early voting] was impressive by any measure. It’s much higher than it was in the early voting in the 2014 midterm election. … Even if Mr. Ossoff falls short, a strong showing — over 45 percent of the vote — would suggest that he would be very competitive in the June runoff. As Cohn notes, polls suggest Ossoff will fall short of 50 percent to avoid a runoff, but the possibility that Ossoff could win outright can’t be ruled out, given how hard it is to poll special elections. * WHAT DEMOCRATS HOPE FOR IN GEORGIA: David Drucker gets the readout from Democratic operatives monitoring the race: Democratic insiders will be watching how close Ossoff gets to 50 percent. Privately, they concede he is headed to a runoff. But operatives say that in a district where the Democrat typically ends up in the 30s, they’ll be satisfied with anything north of 40 percent, hopeful that it will position Ossoff to compete in the runoff. The Republican (Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price) won here by nearly 24 points in 2016, but Trump won it by only 1.5 points, so the question is whether Trump’s awful performance puts it within Democrats’ reach. * TRUMP TRIES TO JUICE TURNOUT IN GEORGIA RACE: Good morning, Mr. President: Democrat Jon Ossoff would be a disaster in Congress. VERY weak on crime and illegal immigration, bad for jobs and wants higher taxes. Say NO — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 18, 2017 This pretty much ensures that Tuesday’s results will be widely read as a referendum on Trump’s tenure thus far. (In my view, we should avoid overinterpreting the outcome, no matter what happens.) * AND IVANKA’S BUSINESS PROSPERS AMID WHITE HOUSE ROLE: The Associated Press reports: On April 6, Ivanka Trump’s company won provisional approval from the Chinese government for three new trademarks, giving it monopoly rights to sell Ivanka brand jewelry, bags and spa services in the world’s second-largest economy. That night, the first daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, sat next to the president of China and his wife for a steak and Dover sole dinner at Mar-a-Lago. The scenario underscores how difficult it is for Trump, who has tried to distance herself from the brand that bears her name, to separate business from politics in her new position at the White House. This implies she wants to “separate business from politics.” Does the conduct of the Trump family suggest thus far that this is what they want?",

      "text" : "President Trump has called for a re-examination of the visa process that allows skilled workers to work in the U.S. Here's why the skilled worker visa program is so controversial. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) If you were bright -- and gifted in science and engineering -- the H-1B visa was your ticket to the United States. But maybe not for long. The lottery for such “high-skilled\" worker visas opened Monday, with the 85,000 slots expected to fill in a matter of days. Nearly three-quarters of the visas are expected to go to Indian workers, as they have in recent years. But the Trump administration injected new uncertainty into the H-1B visa process Monday -- warning employers against discriminating against U.S.-born workers and announcing site visits to companies that employ a high ratio of workers on H-1B visas. President Trump, who campaigned on an \"America First\" ideology, has promised to \"end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program\" and require companies to prioritize American job applicants -- \"no exceptions.\" Trump has also said he would issue an executive order to investigate visa abuses. That order has not been signed. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said while campaigning for Trump that he would consider eliminating H-1B visas altogether -- which would be a major blow to tech companies that rely heavily on foreign workers. On Monday, the Justice Department warned that hiring practices that discriminate against Americans violate federal law. \"The Justice Department will not tolerate employers misusing the H-1B visa process to discriminate against U.S. workers,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler in a prepared statement. \"U.S. workers should not be placed in a disfavored status, and the department is wholeheartedly committed to investigating and vigorously prosecuting these claims.\" Hours later the Department of Homeland Security announced new steps to combat H-1B visa fraud and abuse. The department's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will make unannounced site visits to companies that have a high ratio of workers on H-1B visas, and those whose foreign workers are outsourced to another company. The biggest beneficiary of the system, by far, is India, which produces a steady pipeline of workers trained in math, engineering and science. Seventy one percent of H-1B visa recipients came from India in 2015, according to a 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. China comes in second, accounting for nearly 10 percent of H-1B visa recipients. Source: U.S. Department of Homeland Security Immigration experts expect the trend to continue despite the recent spate of high-profile violent attacks on Indians living in the U.S. Two Indian tech workers were shot at a Kansas bar in February by a gunman yelling \"Get out of my country.” One of the men died. India’s dominance of the H-1B visa system is cemented by the country's giant outsourcing firms that submit tens of thousands of applications, increasing their chances of winning the coveted temporary work visas. [How today's visa restrictions might impact tomorrow's America] Among the top H-1B visa sponsors are Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra Americas -- Indian multinational corporations providing information technology and outsourcing services, according to Myvisajobs.com. Infosys Technologies employees move through the headquarters during a break in Bangalore, India. (AP Photo/Aijaz Rahi, File) The top 20 global outsourcing firms, including those based in other countries, accounted for about 40 percent of the visas available in 2014, according to Ron Hira, a public policy professor at Howard University specializing in high-skill immigration and the American engineering workforce. His research was cited by the New York Times in its 2015 investigation into H-1B visa abuse. The outsourcing firms are controversial because they are exempt from the federal requirement that they not displace American workers if they pay H-1B visa holders at least $60,000 a year. That threshold still falls below the market rate for American tech workers. American tech companies who use workers hired by these firms benefit from the cheaper labor, as well as the automatic loyalty engendered among workers who would otherwise lose their legal status. The H-1B visas last for three years, and can be renewed once. But workers applying for green cards can renew their visas indefinitely. There is currently a decade-long backlog of Indian green card applicants. Given the tremendous delay, companies have an incentive to hire workers from India, who critics say end up in a system of de facto “indentured servitude.” “It’s not because Indians are smarter. These companies want more control over their employees. An immigrant worker has few rights and is now stuck with the employer for many years,” said Aman Kapoor, president of Immigration Voice, a nonprofit advocating on behalf of high-skilled foreign workers concerned about the green card backlogs. Kapoor calls the H-1B visa program a federally sanctioned “long-term employee retention insurance program” because green card applicants cannot change jobs while their applications are pending or they have to re-start their applications. “If an employee is not going anywhere, the employer will not give salary increases,” he said. As a result, “American workers are discriminated against in the job market and immigrant workers are exploited.” Employers and the federal government market the H-1B visa program under the slogan of bringing in “the best and the brightest,” he said. But in reality, he said, “the current system is designed to maintain inequality.” Kapoor himself is a byproduct of the system, having arrived in the United States from India on an H-1B visa for an engineering job in 1997. It took him 12 years to get a green card. Kapoor said he’s now a “proud American citizen” but said he realizes his role in contributing to the current problem. “Knowing what I know today, if I could reverse my life, I would not come back,” he said. Despite the current political climate and concerns about safety given the recent violence against immigrants, Kapoor said “people will keep coming in hopes of making a better life.” Advocates of H-1B visa reform have called for replacing the lottery with a system that takes into account salary and skill. Others want to eliminate the per-country green card caps or impose similar caps on the H-1B system to ease the backlog of Indians waiting for permanent residency. Congress is considering bipartisan bills to raise the salary requirements for H-1B visa workers to $100,000 a year. Still others are lobbying to raise the number of visas issued each year to foreign workers -- currently 65,000 allowed under the cap plus an additional 20,000 for workers with advanced degrees. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, wants to increase the number of H-1B visas to between 115,000 to 195,000 a year. In the San Jose Mercury News last week, Hatch argued for giving some H-1B visa workers the freedom to change jobs. Meanwhile, a new study Monday from New American Economy, a national business coalition founded by former New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, showed a growing gap between the number of science and engineering jobs available and the number of American workers able to fill those jobs. In 2010, there were 5.4 job postings in the area of science, technology, engineering and math for every unemployed worker in these fields, the study says. By 2015, such job postings outnumbered unemployed workers in these fields by a factor of almost 17 to 1. “These numbers are staggering,” said Jeremy Robbins, executive director of New American Economy. “Most of these major tech companies literally have thousands of jobs posted on their websites today that they can’t fill.” But many economists are skeptical that a gap exists between the number of tech jobs and the number of available workers. Guy Berger, LinkedIn economist, said the gap for some science and engineering jobs is more acute in Los Angeles than it is in the San Francisco Bay Area. Engineers looking for work may be better off moving. Companies themselves could mitigate some of the gap by offering higher wages, he said. business wonkblog true Wonkbook newsletter Your daily policy cheat sheet from Wonkblog.

See all newsletters Berger said he’s skeptical of “the idea there’s an immutable shortage you can’t possibly solve” without hiring foreign workers. “In a lot of cases, you can pay people more.” Peter Cappelli, an economist and professor of management at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Trump’s alma mater, said it’s “absolutely not true” that there is a shortage of workers to fill U.S. science and engineering jobs. “Most of the H-1B visas don’t go to the super smarties,” Cappelli said. “It’s typically for mid-level IT folks. They’re not the highest paid jobs.” Companies have an incentive to want to expand the H-1B visa program, he said. Foreign workers are “really, really glad to be here in a way a typical American worker is not,” Cappelli said. “If you could hire a U.S. worker and make sure they can’t quit on you, boy, they would be a ton more valuable.” The future of the H-1B program really becomes a “lobbying question,” he said. “Whose interest is going to be served at whose expense?”",

      "text" : "Tesla is trading up again today, after a strong run yesterday that saw its total market cap value leapfrog Ford’s. It passed GM’s market cap on Tuesday, meaning it’s now the most valuable U.S. automaker as measured by the stock market’s standards.It looked quite likely that this was going to happen yesterday, and Tesla’s stock has been on a tear following its report that both car production and car deliveries were up during the first quarter of the year. The big established U.S. automakers, by contrast, had bad news to report for first quarter vehicle sales in the U.S., which makes Tesla look like a strong growth stock and competitors look like stable performers, at best.\nTesla’s stock is buoyed in large part by its potential: The company has been readying to launch its Model 3 electric vehicle, with a price tag starting at $35,000 U.S. before tax incentives for green vehicles. Demand is incredibly strong, with around 373,000 pre-orders as of May last year. So far, it seems on target to meet its goal of beginning shipment this year, and even delivering some of the first vehicles by the end of 2017.\nTesla was trading up around 1.8 percent as of this writing, with a stock price of $303.89 per share and a total market cap of $53.06 billion, while GM was tracking at around $34.40 per share, with a total market cap of $49.80 billion.",

This time around: When my wife was pregnant with our first child, I was really nervous about the prospect of fatherhood and wasn’t the kindest. After denying the pregnancy was even real, I asked her to abort and said if she didn’t I hoped she miscarried. She had a rough pregnancy health-wise and says she felt very alone. Now, five years later, I love my child dearly and deeply regret my reaction during the first trimester, but my wife will not move past it. She says it deeply hurt her, and she doesn’t know if she’ll ever be able to get over it despite my explaining the fear that caused my reaction. I want another child, but she’s afraid of my reacting in the same way. She thinks I am a great father to our existing child. How can I convince her it will be different this time around? A: It’s good that you now love your child and that you’ve been able to acknowledge, to a certain extent, your past wrongdoing, but you have not correctly identified the scale of your bad behavior. Being “really nervous” and “not the kindest” during a partner’s pregnancy is not the same thing as saying “I hope you have a miscarriage” or denying your partner is pregnant at all. They’re not even in the same ballpark. What you did was abusive, horrifyingly cruel, and wildly beyond the pale of normal behavior. If nothing else, I hope you realize that this was not a standard part of being a nervous first-time parent, and that absolutely nothing could have justified the things you said or did to your wife. Your goal, at this point, should not be convincing your wife to have another child with you. Your goal should be repairing the enormous damage you caused her, making genuine amends, and becoming a different kind of person with a different relationship to fear and anger. Realize, if nothing else, that the reason your wife does not seem able to “get over it” despite your explaining your behavior was motivated by fear, is that the excuse you are offering is flimsy and pathetic. If all you do is flip from trying to force your wife to have an abortion against her will to trying to force her to have another child against her will, you will merely have shifted your method of abusing her. Listen to your wife when she says she does not want to have another child with you. Listen to her when she tells you how you made her feel during her pregnancy. Do not approach these conversations with an agenda or a list of excuses—simply listen. Seek help from a counselor in dealing with your anger management and abusive behavior. Accept the consequences of your actions, and deal with the fact that you may not get the second child you want because of your past actions. Don’t worry about convincing your wife “it will be different this time around.” Subscribe to Prudie! Q. To ask or not to ask: My partner and I have been struggling with infertility, and it may be that we need IVF in order to have a child. IVF is not covered by either my or his health insurance and will be extremely expensive ($10,000 to $18,000). We will be applying for grants, etc., but even the grants will probably not cover all the costs. I know my father would almost certainly help us out if asked. Mom is a different story. My mother and I no longer have a relationship because she tends to insult and belittle me. Lately, she has been telling anyone who will listen that she is retiring soon and won’t be able to take care of us children anymore ... even as she and her new husband vacation in Mexico. However, I will probably see her later this month at my younger brother’s graduation. Do you think it would be worth it to ask her if she would help us pay for IVF? I think she might be insulted if we don’t ask, even if/when she rejects us. Also, this would be her first grandchild. Advertisement A: I don’t think I can advise you to do anything that might encourage your mother’s sense of entitlement when it comes to insulting and belittling you. In general, if you don’t have a relationship with someone, I don’t think you’re in much of a position to ask for a loan or gift. Morever, if your mother were to give you and your partner the money, it sounds like she would have no qualms about holding the debt over your heads and reminding you at every opportunity how much you owe her. I think you would quickly find the cash wasn’t worth the hassle that came with it. Q. Office smells: I was hoping you could help settle an office dispute. I work in a small office of about 15 people. Our break room is small, and many of us eat lunch together there. Recently, a co-worker, “Alice,” brought tuna salad for lunch. Another co-worker at the next table, “Sarah,” was very upset that she had done so and proceeded to loudly tell Alice that her food smelled disgusting. She said that she was very offended that Alice had even thought bringing that would be OK, and that everyone who works in a public space should consider those around her. She ended by telling Alice that she should go somewhere else to eat. Alice came right back at her and said that she had a right to eat what she wanted, that Sarah wasn’t allergic to it, and that she could go somewhere else if she didn’t like her meal. Sarah ended up storming out in anger, and they haven’t really spoken since. While most of us have tried not to be drawn into the argument, the office is pretty evenly split about who was right. Personally, I feel that Sarah is overly sensitive about many things and that Alice had the right to eat what she pleases. If someone is allergic to a certain food or has genuine sensitivities to smell (like perfume) that make them ill, I can see being considerate and accommodating. However, Sarah simply didn’t like it and thought that it was rude to bring something with a strong smell to a public place. No one else was bothered by it. Who was right? What is the line between the right to eat what you please and the possibility of offending someone else? Thank you! A: First the bad news: I will never be able to truly solve this dispute. As long as there are offices and food, there will be Office Food Smell Wars. Both parties will feel that God and Justice and All The Best Smells are on their side, and both parties will put passive-aggressive Post-Its on the communal microwave. The best I can do is try to help this latest salvo, but there is always another battle to be waged. My ruling in this case is as follows: Tuna is no excuse for rudeness. It might have been fine had Sarah approached Alice calmly and asked her not to bring tuna salad into the office because the smell bothered her; it’s never fine to start a conversation with a co-worker about their lunch with that level of high dudgeon. Sarah might have been right had she been willing to state her request reasonably, but she flung herself off the moral high ground the moment she said, “I’m offended you even thought of eating tuna in public.” Advertisement Q. Re: To ask or not to ask?: Last year my husband and I went through IVF. Our fertility specialist actually recommended several places to look for money to pay for it. We ended up getting funded with a loan through Prosperity Bank (an online service where can people ask for or fund loans) for a very good rate. A: It’s a good idea to explore your other financial options! The bank, at the very least, will not call you names. Q. Not a playground: My husband and I retired on a wooded land my grandfather owned back in the 1930s. We have a fishing pond, have several animals (goats, ducks, an old pet pony), and an elaborate treehouse my father built for me as a child. The area has been developed with several gated communities springing up among the farms and newcomers who think our property is a park. We have fences and “no trespassing” signs—it does not stop them. I found mothers with their toddlers feeding the ducks on our pond, I caught one opening our gate so her daughter could pet our pony. All of this is within line of sight of our home! The treehouse especially worries us because it is behind our house and out of sight. We have found all kinds of trash and even beer cans in it. We called the sheriff twice to make reports, but these parents don’t care. One threatened to sue us after we found her 10-year-old son exploring our barn and marched him home! My husband has said we have to destroy the treehouse so our insurance doesn’t go through the roof when one of these kids falls and breaks their neck. This breaks my heart. I want to experience the joy of seeing my grandkids in it. My husband is getting geese and trained dogs for us in the future, but is there anything I can say to these people to make them stop? A: Since so many of your neighbors seem drawn to your property like moths to a flame, I don’t think speaking to them individually is going to be your best strategy; you might consider replacing the fences you have now with something taller and sturdier and generally harder for children to climb over. If any readers have other successful strategies for keeping neighbors off their attractive-nuisance-style properties, please share them! Advertisement Q. Single mother: My father passed away more than 10 years ago rather suddenly. My mother dated a man for a while a few years ago, but she left him because his drinking was out of control. Her friends are all couples that have been married nearly 40 years, and she loves them, but she often feels like a third wheel (or fifth or seventh). My mom is awesome—she’s funny and intelligent and beautiful and has lots of friends and hobbies, but I know she’s missing consistent companionship (i.e. a man-friend). I keep steering her toward online dating, but she won’t bite. Aside from going to weird over-60 bars, what can I do to help her? Is it wrong to set up a profile and forward her the responses? More than anyone I know, she deserves to be happy, and I just want her to find someone that shares her interests and treats her well. A: If your mother won’t bite when it comes to online dating, don’t bite for her. Your anxiety over her loneliness is well-intentioned, but she’s a grown woman who’s already demonstrated an ability to go out on dates when she’s been so moved in the past. It may be that while she experiences pangs of loneliness, especially when she’s out with friends in long-term relationships, she doesn’t consider the headaches of dating to be worth it. It may be that she’s afraid, or a little too comfortable in her daily routine, or any number of other possibilities, but I don’t think any of them can be helped by interference from her adult child. The most you can do is express love and support for her, then let her make her own decisions. She knows online dating is an option, and if she ever wants to try it, the internet will still be there. If she doesn’t want to, I think you should let well enough alone, and talk to her about her friends, or her hobbies, or about something new that’s going on in your life, instead. Q. Re: Not a playground: I work in insurance, and in addition to taller fences that completely surround the perimeter, they should make sure that all gates are kept locked. A: This should deter even the most determined of young mothers, who lives only for feeding ducks with her children. Advertisement Q. Why be good?: Now that my children are getting older, I’m struggling with how to convince them (and myself) that being a good person is the right thing to do. Being unrelentingly kind and generous and never raising a fuss, like my parents expected me to be, didn’t get me anywhere. Quite the opposite! My behavior made me the target of bullies for 13 years, got me dumped so many times, and got me passed over for raises and promotions, etc. It wasn’t until I stood up for myself in a big way that people started treating me with respect. So the bully? He left me alone when I slammed him into a locker junior year. No amount of ignoring him for 13 years made him stop. The exes? When my husband was on the fence about our future, I told him not to contact me again and that I was moving on. A proposal came the next day. The boss I bent over backward for but was horrible to me? She was begging me to stay the day I found a better job. Being nice didn’t do anything but make things worse. I think that’s largely because we’re pre-programmed to take and take and take until a dramatic response forces us to back off. These days, I don’t take crap from people, and I establish that early on. The path has been a different kind of difficult, but I don’t get taken advantage of anymore, and I don’t regret it. So what do I tell my kids when these kindness and respect discussions come up? I don’t want them to have the same fate I did, but that goes against conventional wisdom. My husband and I both want our kids to have strong spines and call people out as needed. A: I have good news for you: None of the behaviors you described above disqualify you from being a good person! It sounds like for many years you believed that “being a good person” and “never advocating for yourself or setting boundaries” were the same thing, and this resulted in a lot of frustration and pain. Telling your boss that you found another job, or letting a partner know that you’re moving on from the relationship because you have different goals—those weren’t rude or selfish things to do. I don’t recommend telling your kids to shove their bullies into lockers as their very first option, but it sounds like your reaction was understandable, given the circumstances. “Being nice” does not mean “never stating your needs or defending yourself.” You can be kind and stand up for yourself, and it sounds like you’ve been able to figure out how to do both as an adult in ways you couldn’t before. Kindness is not the same thing as endlessly absorbing whatever garbage someone else wants to send your way; teach your kids to be as kind to themselves as they are to others. Top Comment We used to have a problem with kids cutting through our property to get to the high school instead of going one block down. At first it wasnt to bad of a problem. More... Join In Q. Can I ask for more compliments?: I am in a wonderful relationship. But my partner doesn’t really communicate how he feels about me very often. I am an extremely verbal person and love telling him all the things I like about him often. My last ex was extremely verbal, but his actions never matched his words. My current partner does all the right things, his actions prove he cares about me and that he’s serious, which I know in many ways is way more important. Is it stupid to tell him I could use more verbal appreciation? I mentioned casually I was throwing a pair of pants away and he was like oh no I love how those look on you—I’ve worn these pants dozens of times in front of him and he’d never commented on them once. I don’t need constant verbal affection or validation but it would be nice to receive a little more frequently. I know different people express themselves differently and I’m trying to be understanding but at times I get frustrated because I feel like I don’t even really know why he’s with me. Is this stupid and should I just let it go or is it worth asking about? A: It is never stupid to tell your partner about your emotional needs! Tell him how much it meant to you the other day when he told you he liked something you wore, that you love hearing affirming words from him, and you’d like to hear them more often. You’re not demanding anything; you’re letting him know one of the best ways to make you feel loved. You might then ask him if there’s anything in particular that you for him do that makes him feel valued, and thus spread sweetness and light all around. Mallory Ortberg: Thanks, everyone!

      "text" : "BETHLEHEM, West Bank — The two tourists were from Berlin, so they knew something about walls. There they sat, one with tea, another with cappuccino, on tasteful patio chairs, across an alley from the ugly 26-foot symbol of all that separates Israelis from Palestinians.This section of the West Bank separation barrier was built 15 years ago, as violence raged. It is now a quiet tourist destination in the city where Jesus Christ was born: a hotel, gallery, museum, bookstore and spray paint shop by the elusive British artist Banksy. It is part whimsy and spectacle (note the plastic greeter chimp), part serious (note the very real Israeli security cameras).“Weird,” one of the Berlin tourists, Nadja Miller, 38, said. “It’s voyeuristic. At the same time it raises awareness that it exists and discussion about it.”It has been just over a month since Banksy opened the Walled Off Hotel here — and unsurprisingly it is proving popular: Its nine rooms are booked through June, for rates from $30 a night to $965 for the “presidential suite.” Some 700 people visit a day, the owner says, 200 of them Palestinian. Many arrive on tour buses passing through checkpoints.Some art is meant to inflict discomfort. Banksy’s hotel — which brags of the “worst view in the world” — falls clearly into that category, though visitors say the discomfort comes in awkward waves. There is the wall itself, endlessly debated over whether it comprises cell walls for Palestinians, a security measure that worked or 400 miles of proof of the failure of negotiations.That is enough for some visitors. “All the world must see what is happening in the West Bank,” said Emad Khleif, 50, a Palestinian banker who brought his family to visit from Nazareth.But not all locals are happy with the hotel. (“Who is this for?” barked a Palestinian woman, Sowsan Hashem, 49, standing just outside.) Some foreign visitors said it made them a little queasy. Part of the blame might come from Banksy’s unsubtle, commercial style. Part is from a feeling of “oppression tourism,” which allows those who pay $20 or so to stencil political messages on the wall with spray paint. Part is that the hotel is just, well, pretty nice, given everything.“Decadent” was the word used by one guest, Michael McLaughlin, 35, who noted the difference between the hotel and the Palestinian refugee camp where he had just spent a week as part of his work as an actor and a filmmaker.“The irony is not lost on me,” he said. But he expressed support for the project. “It’s creative activism, an act that has infinitely more power than a gun.”Ibrahim Abdel Rahman, 32, the owner of a tire shop down the street, said he had been ordered to shut down as the area spruced up. “There is something strange about that hotel,” he said. “It’s more of a project of encouraging normalization of the occupation.”Banksy has a long history in Bethlehem: Four well-known works are here, including “Girl and a Soldier,” and a dove protected by an armored vest.The artist has said that the separation barrier “essentially turns Palestine into the world’s largest open prison,” though several emails sent to an address for Banksy were not answered. Yet he has not become an internal symbol of anti-Israeli activism, which is encountering growing legal resistance inside Israel.A major retrospective of Banksy’s work that opened a week ago just outside Tel Aviv is to run through Tuesday.His website says of the hotel, “Operated by the local community, we offer a warm welcome to everyone from all sides of the conflict and across the world.”It is not as easy, though, for those on the Israeli side to visit. Technically the area is under Israeli control, but the roads and checkpoints place the trip itself in a legal gray zone. Four admittedly scared Hebrew University students persuaded an Arab friend to take them the other day.“It’s Palestine,” said one student, Shaya Bon Stein, 29. “It’s dangerous.”All but one were art students, who all consciously tried to dress like Europeans, and they conceded that the danger might be more perceived than real.They were eager to see the hotel itself and its statement about the wall, something they do not get to see from the other side.“Is this a joke?” is first up on the questions section of the hotel’s website. The answer is perhaps the business’s least ironic aspect: “Nope — it’s a genuine art hotel with fully functioning en suite facilities and limited car parking.”It is also not meant as a moneymaker: The hotel, on the site of a former pottery workshop, is owned by a local businessman, Wissam Salsaa. The website says all profits will be returned to the community.Still, it has a feeling both of humor and commercialism: The coffee is excellent, and the hotel serves the “best hummus in the region” (according to the kitchen staff, the website jokes).The motif is best described as decadent colonial, but in place of mounted deer heads are security cameras and slingshots. A gallery upstairs, where paintings by Palestinian artists can run $10,000, features even more valuable works by Banksy himself. Most striking is a mural of an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian man wrapped in a kaffiyeh pounding each other with pillows billowing with feathers, invoking Goya’s “Fight With Cudgels” of two men planted to their knees, condemned to proximity and so endlessly trying to kill each other.An animatronic Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary, signs the paper that established a Jewish state 100 years ago. (“Press button for historic re-enactment.”) It is 50 years since the 1967 war in which Israel captured East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan, beginning an occupation that, for now, is partly managed, and limned, by the wall.Finally, there is the wall itself: The concrete — visible from most parts of this hotel only feet away — is covered with graffiti. The Berliners finished their drinks as they gazed at a stencil reading: “Mr. Trump. Walls = Hate.” Doves perched on barbed wire.Saher Touna, 17, one of the Palestinian tourists from Nazareth, bought a stencil from the “WallMart,” next to the hotel, which sells spray paint and offers a ladder.“My home is here, my land is here,” she sprayed in Arabic. “It’s racist, and it’s here,” she said of the wall. “Might as well make something beautiful out of it.”",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — When President Trump welcomes President Xi Jinping of China to his palm-fringed Florida club for two days of meetings on Thursday, the studied informality of the gathering will bear the handiwork of two people: China’s ambassador to Washington and Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.The Chinese ambassador, Cui Tiankai, has established a busy back channel to Mr. Kushner, according to several officials briefed on the relationship. The two men agreed on the club, Mar-a-Lago, as the site for the meeting, and the ambassador even sent Mr. Kushner drafts of a joint statement that China and the United States could issue afterward.Mr. Kushner’s central role reflects not only the peculiar nature of this first meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, but also of the broader relationship between the United States and China in the early days of the Trump administration. It is at once highly personal and bluntly transactional — a strategy that carries significant risks, experts said, given the economic and security issues that already divide the countries.While Chinese officials have found Mr. Trump a bewildering figure with a penchant for inflammatory statements, they have come to at least one clear judgment: In Mr. Trump’s Washington, his son-in-law is the man to know.Mr. Kushner first made his influence felt in early February when he and Mr. Cui orchestrated a fence-mending phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. During that exchange, Mr. Trump pledged to abide by the four-decade-old “One China” policy on Taiwan, despite his earlier suggestion that it was up for negotiation.Now, officials said, Mr. Trump wants something in return: He plans to press Mr. Xi to intensify economic sanctions against North Korea to pressure the country to shut down its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He has also vowed to protest the chronic trade imbalance between the United States and China, which he railed against during his presidential campaign.China’s courtship of Mr. Kushner, which has coincided with the marginalization of the State Department in the Trump administration, reflects a Chinese comfort with dynastic links. Mr. Xi is himself a “princeling”: His father was Xi Zhongxun, a major figure in the Communist revolution who was later purged by Mao Zedong.Not only is Mr. Kushner married to the president’s daughter Ivanka, but he is also one of his most influential advisers — a 36-year-old with no previous government experience but an exceptionally broad portfolio under his father-in-law.“Since Kissinger, the Chinese have been infatuated with gaining and maintaining access to the White House,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a senior director for Asia in the Obama administration. “Having access to the president’s family and somebody they see as a princeling is even better.”Former American officials and China experts warned that the Chinese had prepared more carefully for this visit than the White House, which is still debating how harshly to confront Beijing, and which has yet to fill many important posts in the State Department. Several said that if Mr. Trump presented China with an ultimatum on North Korea, it could backfire.Shortly after winning the election, Mr. Trump said he might use the “One China” policy, under which the United States recognizes a single Chinese government in Beijing and has severed its diplomatic ties with Taiwan, as a bargaining chip for greater Chinese cooperation on trade or North Korea.Mr. Trump had thrown that policy into doubt after taking a congratulatory phone call from the president of Taiwan. That caused consternation in Beijing, and Mr. Xi refused to get on the phone with Mr. Trump until he reaffirmed the policy.After the two leaders finally spoke, the White House said in a statement that the men had “discussed numerous topics, and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our One China policy.” Mr. Trump insisted on that wording, according to a person briefed on the process, because he wanted to make clear that he had made a concession to Mr. Xi.Since that call, Mr. Cui has continued to cultivate the Kushner family. Later in February, he invited Ivanka and the couple’s daughter, Arabella, to a reception at the Chinese Embassy to celebrate the Lunar New Year.Inside the White House, the most visible sign of Mr. Kushner’s influence on China policy came in March at the beginning of a meeting of the National Security Council’s “principals committee” to discuss North Korea.He was seated at the table in the Situation Room when Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, walked in. Seeing no chairs open, General Dunford headed for the backbenches, according to two people who were there. Mr. Kushner, they said, quickly offered his chair to General Dunford and took a seat along the wall.While administration officials confirm that Mr. Kushner is deeply involved in China relations, they insist that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has taken the lead on policy and made many of the decisions on the choreography and agenda of the meeting at Mar-a-Lago.In March, Mr. Tillerson made his first trip to Beijing as secretary of state, during which he and Mr. Xi discussed the planning in a 30-minute meeting. He was criticized afterward for repeating the phrases “mutual respect” and “win-win solutions,” which are drawn from the Chinese diplomatic lexicon and have been interpreted to assert a Chinese sphere of influence over the South China Sea and other disputed areas.A senior American official said that Mr. Tillerson applied his own meaning to those phrases — “win-win,” he said, was originally an American expression — and was not accepting China’s definition. He said the secretary had adopted a significantly tougher tone in private, particularly about China’s role in curbing North Korea’s provocations.Mr. Kushner has passed on proposals he got from Mr. Cui to Mr. Tillerson, who in turn has circulated them among his staff in the State Department, officials said. But the department’s influence has been reduced as many positions remain unfilled, including that of assistant secretary for East Asian affairs. Though Mr. Tillerson has kept a low profile, officials said he was trying to develop his own relationship with Mr. Trump at regular lunches and dinners.Mr. Kushner’s involvement in China policy prompted questions after reports that his company was negotiating with a politically connected Chinese firm to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in his family’s flagship property, 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.On Wednesday, amid the glare of negative publicity, Mr. Kushner’s company ended negotiations with the firm, the Anbang Insurance Group.Another question hanging over the meeting is whether the hard-liners in the White House will wield their influence. Mr. Trump ran for the presidency on a stridently anti-China platform, accusing the Chinese, wrongly, of continuing to depress the value of their currency, and threatening to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports.The architects of that policy — Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist, and Peter Navarro, the director of the National Trade Council — have said little publicly about China since entering the White House. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump predicted that the meeting would be “very difficult” because, as he said on Twitter, the United States would no longer tolerate “massive trade deficits.”By inviting Mr. Xi to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s “Southern White House,” the president is conferring on him the same status as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who spent two days in Florida, playing golf with the president and responding to a crisis after North Korea tested a ballistic missile. Such a gesture is particularly valuable, experts said, given that China is not an ally like Japan.Mr. Xi does not play golf — as part of his anti-corruption campaign, he cracked down on Communist Party officials’ playing the sport — so he and Mr. Trump will have to find other ways to fill the 25 hours that the Chinese president will be at the club. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, will host Mr. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, for dinner.There are obvious parallels between the Mar-a-Lago meeting and the 2013 summit meeting at Sunnylands in California, Walter Annenberg’s 200-acre estate, where President Barack Obama and Mr. Xi got acquainted over long walks in the desert landscape and a dinner of grilled porterhouse steaks and cherry pie. But there are important differences, too.By the time Mr. Obama met with Mr. Xi in California, they had already met once before, when Mr. Xi was vice president. Mr. Xi held extensive meetings with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., traveling with him around the United States. Some former officials said the Mar-a-Lago meeting might reveal the disparity in experience between the two leaders and their teams.“Sunnylands was difficult because Xi was new, while Obama had his sea legs,” said Mr. Medeiros, the former Obama administration official. “What’s interesting is that the polarity here is reversed. Xi has his sea legs; Trump does not.”",

      "text" : "US President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel hold a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 17, 2017. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images requirejs([\"jquery\"], function($) ); We all knew that the White House meeting between President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been awkward. But things were even more uncomfortable than we thought. Turns out Trump’s version of diplomacy with one of the country’s most important allies in Europe involves handing over a bill for billions of dollars that the White House believes it owes NATO, according to the Times of London. One German minister did not hesitate to qualify the invoice as “outrageous,” saying the intent was clear. “The concept behind putting out such demands is to intimidate the other side, but the chancellor took it calmly and will not respond to such provocations,” the minister said. Advertisement Although no one confirmed how much the total invoice was for, a calculation by the Times suggests the total was around $312 billion for the shortfall in spending and around $62 billion in interest. Trump has long criticized Germany and numerous other NATO countries for failing to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense, as they had pledged to do in 2014. So how did the White House get to $374 billion? It went further back, taking 2002 as a starting point, noting that was when Merkel’s predecessor vowed to boost spending on defense. “The president has a very unorthodox view on NATO defense spending,” an official tells the Times. That is one polite way of putting it, others have flat out said that Trump’s statements on NATO suggest he really does not understand how the alliance is funded. Merkel reportedly “ignored the provocation.” She appears to be a bit more adept at diplomacy than her U.S. counterpart.",

      "text" : "So you just got offered a new job or negotiated your way to a higher salary? Congratulations! But if you're not careful, two paychecks from now you're going to be wondering how you ever lived on less, rather than rejoicing in how much you're socking away.  Congratulations! You've worked hard for it. Now it's time to make that money work hard for you. Robert Daly / Getty Images Stock \"Most people expand their spending according to their new salary,\" says Kit Yarrow, author of Decoding the New Consumer Mind. \"Every category seems to get a boost, and all of a sudden, that increase in salary hasn't stretched across all those categories.\" Take a look at your budget to see how you can best use this opportunity to improve your future: Get the most emotional bang for your buck If you don't want to saddle yourself with a house or car payment (and you're at a stage in life where you don't have to), then don't, says Yarrow. Purposely save for your goal, whether it's to visit Thailand or pay down debt. When people are budgeting for things that don't match their goals or bring them joy, \"they cheat, and when they cheat, they feel bad about themselves, and when they feel bad about themselves, their budgets tend to get wacky,\" says Yarrow. Be true to yourself and what drives you as a person. Spend your values Now that we've established that you should save for your goals… how do you figure out what they are? You can use your new job as a jumping-off point to ask yourself what you care about and what you want your money to do to line up with your values, says Jesse Mecham, founder of You Need A Budget. How do you start? By not thinking about money at all. Sit down and make a list of your aspirations and what drives you. Examples could be kids, travel and health. Then, dive deeper — what is it about health? Good food and exercise? And deeper — what kind of food? Soon, you'll have specific items to budget for and a better idea of the jobs you want each dollar to do for you. You can weave these goals into a budget with your fixed expenses and use it as a guide for achieving your goals, both personal and financial. Know your vice \"The Achilles heel of young people in particular is breaking their budget on going out,\" says Yarrow. So whether your number one spots are the bars, concerts or hot new restaurants, there are a couple of things you can do to make sure your entertainment spending doesn't rise along with your new salary. You could diversify your friend group and hang out more with the frugal folks, find different ways to entertain yourself, or be honest about how much you spent before the raise and build that amount into your budget. Make it a realistic one that matches your life and what you really want. So if eating out is your number-one cash flow issue, have your friends over for a potluck or DIY cooking night. If it's concerts and festivals? Organize a bike ride. \"You've got to be the maverick and be really clear on what your spending goals are. Try to encourage your friends to accommodate you,\" says Yarrow. Hike up your retirement plan contributions Then of course, there's the opportunity to save more for retirement — which should be one of (if not the) first things you focus on when getting a salary bump or starting a new job, says Kelly Graves, certified financial planner. Some employers allow employees to enroll in the company 401(k) on day one, and some have a one-year rule before they're eligible. If it's the former, make that your first priority. If it's the latter, make a note in your calendar. But for now (or if you work for a place without a retirement plan) start or ratchet up your contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA. Eventually, you want to be saving 15 percent of what you earn (including matching contributions) for retirement. But if you're not there yet, don't panic — increase your savings by as much as your new salary allows. The key is to automate, so you don't have to make the decision every time. Use your extra money to pay down debt There's no better return on your money (except, perhaps, for 401(k) matching dollars) than the one you get paying down high interest rate credit card debt. The return you get is equal to your interest rate — and it's guaranteed. So if you're carrying credit card debt, that bump in your salary is money you can use to finally get it off your plate. Start with your highest interest rate card and pay as much as you can toward that one while making minimum payments on the rest; when it's retired, move on to the one with the next highest interest rate. Build up an emergency fund Finally, use some of that additional income to build up an emergency fund of at least $2,000. No, it's not the full six-to-nine month cushion you should aspire to over time, but a couple thousand can help you avoid a laundry list of smaller financial disasters. \"You're going to have a health emergency, the car's going to break down… you lose jobs, and you're going to need something to bridge that gap,\" says Graves.

      "text" : "BEIJING — As tensions mounted on the Korean Peninsula, Adm. Harry Harris made a dramatic announcement: An aircraft carrier had been ordered to sail north from Singapore on April 8 toward the Western Pacific. A spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command, which Harris heads, linked the deployment directly to the “number one threat in the region,” North Korea, and its “reckless, irresponsible and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability.” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on April 11 that the Carl Vinson was “on her way up there.” Asked about the deployment in an interview with Fox Business Network that aired April 12, President Trump said: “We are sending an armada, very powerful.” U.S. media went into overdrive, and Fox reported on April 14 that the armada was “steaming” toward North Korea. But pictures posted by the U.S. Navy suggest that’s not quite the case — or at least not yet. A photograph released by the Navy showed the aircraft carrier sailing through the calm waters of Sunda Strait between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java on Saturday, April 15. By later in the day, it was in the Indian Ocean, according to Navy photographs. In other words, on the same day that the world nervously watched North Korea stage a massive military parade to celebrate the birthday of the nation’s founder, Kim Il Sung, and the press speculated about a preemptive U.S. strike, the U.S. Navy put the Carl Vinson, together with its escort of two guided-missile destroyers and a cruiser, more than 3,000 miles southwest of the Korean Peninsula — and more than 500 miles southeast of Singapore. Instead of steaming toward the Korea Peninsula, the carrier strike group was actually headed in the opposite direction to take part in “scheduled exercises with Australian forces in the Indian Ocean,” according to Defense News, which first reported the story. Neither the Pacific Command nor the Pacific Fleet responded immediately to requests for comment. On Monday, Cmdr. Clayton Doss, a Pacific Fleet spokesman, said only that the USS Carl Vinson and its escorts were “transiting the Western Pacific.” He declined to give a more precise location except to rule out the waters around South Korea or Japan. The presence of the U.S. carrier strike group, and the threat of a U.S. military strike on North Korea, had weighed heavily on Chinese minds and in the media here. Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned that “storm clouds” were gathering and the risk of conflict rising. The news that the ships were not where everyone assumed them to be was greeted with some glee in the Chinese media Tuesday. “Tricked badly!” the Global Times exulted on its social media account. “None of the U.S. aircraft carriers that South Korea is desperately waiting for has come!” (Reuters) Was it all a misunderstanding, or deliberate obfuscation? Cai Jian, an expert from the Center for Korean Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the whole episode was part of an elaborate game of “psychological warfare or bluffing” by the United States. He argued that Washington never really intended to launch a military strike on North Korea right now. “At the peak of the standoff, psychological warfare is very important,” he said. Ross Babbage, a nonresident senior fellow at the Center for Strategic Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based think tank that focuses on the military, said the move may be “military signaling” by the United States. “It’s more than a bluff,” he said. “A bluff suggests you’re not serious. My understanding is that this U.S. administration is dead serious. It’s been 40 years of trying to get the North Koreans to back away from the nuclear weapons.” Babbage said it was also possible that the Trump administration had decided to give China a little time to put its own pressure on North Korea before sending the carrier strike group north. Trump met his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, on April 6 and 7 and spoke by phone with him on April 11, and may have wanted to give the Chinese some breathing space to before “rattling the bars,” Babbage said. Nor should the aircraft carrier’s presence, alone, be given too much weight, he added, since any early strikes on North Korea would likely have been carried out by long-range aircraft. Mattis said the U.S. administration was working closely with China to address the issue of North Korea’s nuclear program. “You’re aware that the leader of North Korea again recklessly tried to provoke something by launching a missile,” Mattis told reporters Tuesday on his way to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. “It shows why we’re working so closely right now with the Chinese coming out of the Mar-a-Lago meeting . . . to try to get this under control and to aim for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula that China and the United States, South Korea and Japan all share that same interest in.” While the belief that the Carl Vinson was heading toward Korea was reported as fact by media outlets around the world, there were hints it was perhaps not steaming there as fast as many supposed. On April 11, U.S. Naval Institute News reported that although the carrier had canceled port calls in Australia, it had not scrubbed training events to move faster toward the Korean Peninsula, and would still take more than a week to enter waters near Korea — a point that was lost amid heated talk of “war.” Other photographs released by the Navy showed the Carl Vinson in the South China Sea from April 12 to 14.

      "text" : "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin listens as President Trump speaks during a budget meeting at the White House. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) The White House will release on Wednesday the “broad principles and priorities” of their plans to overhaul federal taxes, a White House official said Friday night, downplaying expectations that the Trump administration would reveal key details underpinning the plan. President Trump said earlier Friday that he would release new information about his plan to overhaul the tax code on Wednesday, a sign that he is trying to accelerate one of his most ambitious campaign promises even though key specifics remain undetermined. “We’ll be having a big announcement on Wednesday having to do with tax reform,” Trump said Friday while visiting the Treasury Department. “The process has begun long ago but it really formally begins on Wednesday.” Addressing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump said, “So, go to it.” A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The Washington Post on Friday night that while the president did plan to make an announcement on tax reform next week, it will be broad in nature. “[W] e will outline our broad principles and priorities,” the official said. \"We are moving forward on comprehensive tax reform that cuts tax rates for individuals, simplifies our overly-complicated system and creates jobs by making American businesses competitive.” Trump’s statement earlier on Friday had caught many congressional aides — and even some administration officials — off guard, as they thought they were working on a slower timetable. With his unexpected comments, Trump has jolted the process forward as he tries to breathe new life into an effort that risked becoming bogged down like other campaign priorities. But if he only issues the broad outline of a plan, he could further complicate lawmakers and many in the business community, who have been hoping the White House would weigh in on key questions, such as how it plans to tax imports or whether it will pursue the elimination of any tax deductions. Trump plans a major cut in tax rates, focused on simplifying the tax code for individuals and families, lowering the corporate tax rate and a large tax cut for the middle class. He has also said he wants to create some sort of “reciprocity” tax that imposes a tariff-like tax on imports from countries that have tariffs against the United States. Earlier Friday, Trump told the Associated Press in an interview that the tax cuts he would propose would be \"massive\" and perhaps the biggest of all time. Mnuchin has worked on the tax plan for months, but details have remained fluid, with White House officials considering a range of options in how they restructure the tax code. White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn suggested Thursday that many of the details were still in flux during comments he made to the Institute of International Finance. Trump has said a big tax cut will boost economic growth, help companies invest, and lead to more job creation. But Democrats and some Republicans have said any cut in rates should be offset by the elimination of tax breaks to prevent the changes from widening the budget deficit. Trump comments on cutting taxes, border wall Embed Copy Share Play Video1:17 Speaking at a rally in Nashville, President Trump said \"I want to cut hell out of taxes.\" (The Washington Post) Speaking at a rally in Nashville, President Trump said \"I want to cut hell out of taxes.\" Speaking at a rally in Nashville, President Trump said \"I want to cut hell out of taxes.\" (The Washington Post) Mnuchin said Thursday that the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves because there would be so much economic growth that it would bring in new revenue to the Treasury Department. Both Trump and Mnuchin have promised that the overhaul of the tax code they are planning would be the biggest since the Reagan administration. During the campaign, Trump proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, and he also wants to cut the rates individuals and families pay. He has said he wants a big tax cut for the middle class, though many politicians define “middle class” differently. \"People can’t do their returns,\" Trump said Friday. \"They have no idea what they are doing. They are too complicated.\" Many congressional aides were caught by surprise from Trump's announcement, as White House officials have expressed that they were working hard on a plan but nowhere near ready to provide new information. Lawmakers have been anxiously waiting for more details of Trump’s plan for weeks. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters “I appreciate the President’s leadership and strong commitment to comprehensive tax reform,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said Friday. “Ways and Means Republicans are ready to work with President Trump and his team on reforms that will grow our economy, create jobs, and increase paychecks.” The release will come during a critical period for Trump. House Republicans are also working on plans to vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act next week, and Congress must vote by Friday to continue funding the government or there will be a partial shutdown. One reason overhauling the tax code is so difficult is because it is very difficult to do it without dramatically widening the deficit. Many lawmakers want to cut taxes, but cutting tax rates leads to a big drop in revenue, which makes the deficit larger unless there is a sharp contraction in spending. Trump has proposed to boost spending, at least in the short term, and many budget experts believe the tax plan he offered during the campaign would grow the federal debt. President Barack Obama proposed lowering the corporate tax rate several years ago, but he also proposed raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans as a way to offset some of the lost revenue. This led to major blowback from many Republicans who saw it as a way of raising taxes. He also proposed limiting the deductions that the wealthiest Americans could claim, something that was also rejected. Trump administration officials have said they will propose limiting some tax breaks, but this is not expected to be a big component of their plan. Instead, they are going to assume future economic growth caused by the tax cuts will create trillions of dollars in new revenue, a controversial assumption that many GOP congressional aides on Capitol Hill have cautioned against.",

      "text" : "A weekend of official explanations for President Trump’s airstrikes on a Syrian air base has only deepened the confusion over his intentions, next steps and the legal basis for his unilateral use of force in the middle of that complicated, intractable civil war. The administration will have to do better than this.Presidents have an obligation to explain military operations to the American people and the world, and, when possible, most begin making their argument well before they take action. In Mr. Trump’s case, the need for clarity is even greater given that the attack on Thursday, in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons on civilians, was a reversal of the position he campaigned on just months ago.Now that Mr. Trump has ordered a strike against the Assad government, how far is he prepared to go to end the six-year-old civil war? What does the operation say about his willingness to use force beyond Syria? One troublesome answer may be found in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s comments on Monday. “We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world,” he said on a trip to a World War II memorial in Italy, a trip aimed at rallying allies and Russia around a strategy to end the Syrian war.His words could foreshadow an extraordinary expansion of American intervention. That would defy Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to put “America First.”These and other comments added to confusion over whether the administration’s focus will be on ousting Mr. Assad or on sticking with Mr. Trump’s stated priority of defeating the Islamic State. Mr. Tillerson, on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, said “we believe that the first priority is the defeat of ISIS.” Only after that threat is reduced or eliminated would he turn to a cease-fire process leading to elections so the Syrians could decide Mr. Assad’s fate, he said.The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, suggested Mr. Assad’s ouster would have to come before a political transition. “There’s not any sort of option where a political solution is going to happen with Assad at the head of the regime,” she said on CNN. On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” she said there could be other priorities, like getting Iran out of Syria, which would put the United States in direct conflict with one of Mr. Assad’s main backers.H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, tried to paper over the differences on Fox News, but while he put more emphases on defeating ISIS, he also said the administration might take further action against Mr. Assad including for the use of conventional weapons.There is also confusion over the strikes’ legality. Whether they were a one-off attack designed to deter chemical weapons use or the start of a larger operation, Mr. Trump has failed to make a compelling legal case, or obtain proper international and congressional authorization, for attacking a sovereign nation.The White House issued a statement suggesting the attack complied with international law because Mr. Assad violated an international chemical weapons treaty and caused severe humanitarian distress. But Mr. Trump did not seek authorization from the Security Council to use force, as the United Nations Charter requires, or have a valid reason for acting in self-defense.The statement also suggested Mr. Trump’s action complied with American law because of his powers under Article II of the Constitution to defend national interests by force. President Barack Obama used the same vague argument to justify the Libya intervention of 2011, though many legal experts questioned it then and still do.Too often in recent years, presidents have taken military action without the authorization of Congress, which shares war-making responsibilities with the president. It is essential that Congress consider a new authorization for the use of military force in Syria both to demonstrate the need for legal justification for military action and to ensure a full vetting of Mr. Trump’s intentions there.",

      "text" : "Story highlightsThere is a fierce race to replace HHS Secretary Tom Price in Georgia's 6th DistrictDemocrat Jon Ossoff wants to finish with more than 50% of the vote to avoid a runoffThe district has been reliably Republican though the vote margin was slim in November (CNN)The eyes of the political world are on Atlanta's northern suburbs Tuesday as voters go to the polls in a special election that's about much more than the House seat up for grabs. Democrat Jon Ossoff is aiming to win the seat outright -- topping 50% and avoiding a runoff. If he succeeds, it would deliver a major blow to President Donald Trump and suggest the GOP's House majority is in jeopardy in the 2018 midterms. The race is to replace new Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Georgia's 6th District -- long a reliable Republican stronghold and the seat Newt Gingrich held on his rise to becoming House speaker in the 1990s. It's a \"jungle primary\" featuring 18 candidates -- including 11 Republicans and four Democrats. If no one tops 50%, the top two finishers will advance to a June runoff. Really, though, it's all about Ossoff -- the only candidate who is expected to be in the ballpark of 50%.

In large part thanks to the liberal blog Daily Kos, Ossoff raised a staggering $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 -- a figure made possible by his stature as the only Democrat with a clear path to flipping a Republican-held seat in one of the four special elections to replace Trump Cabinet selections this spring. Ossoff benefits from being the only serious Democrat candidate, while Republicans have seen infighting among their 11 candidates -- including several with high-profile support and campaigns, including former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, state Sen. Judson Hill, businessman and former state Sen. Dan Moody and Johns Creek City Councilman Bob Gray. For Democrats, the race also offers a preview of its 2018 roadmap. The suburban district has all the characteristics -- diversity, including Latino voters, higher-than-average education levels and a younger population -- of those it hopes to flip in areas like Orange County, California, and the Texas suburbs. RELATED: Dems look south to test anti-Trump strategyIt took a sudden evolution for the district to become competitive at all. Mitt Romney carried it over Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election by more than 23 percentage points, after all. But 2016 told a much different story. Trump bested Hillary Clinton in the district by just 1.5 points. And Clinton carried Cobb County -- a key population base of the district. It was the first time a Democrat had won Cobb County since Georgia's Jimmy Carter was on the ballot. Trump has repeatedly weighed in on the race in recent days, tweeting Monday: \"The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia (congressional) race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!\"var id = '//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js'.replace(/\\s+/g, '');!!document.getElementById(id) || (function makeEmbedScript(d, id) (document, id));The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 17, 2017He also recorded a robocall attacking Ossoff the evening before the special election and telling voters they need to vote for any of the Republicans in the field.\"If you don't vote tomorrow, Ossoff will raise your taxes, destroy your health care and flood our country with illegal immigrants,\" Trump said. \"Vote Republican.\"Republicans have long believed that all they must do is survive Tuesday without Ossoff hitting the 50% mark. If he falls short, the party believes Republican voters will coalesce around their nominee, preventing Ossoff's numbers from climbing any higher in a runoff. Democrats, though, note that Ossoff -- who has dominated the airwaves -- has still faced an onslaught of more than $4 million in attack ads from the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC. \"Ossoff will finally have an opponent to set up a clear and beneficial contrast. Until now, the Republican candidates have faced very little scrutiny or negative ads,\" said Meredith Kelly, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's communications director. RELATED: Democrats target black voters as money pours into Georgia House raceOssoff has faced criticism for the amount of money coming from outside the region and the fact that while he's originally from the district, he doesn't currently live there now.Ossoff defended himself against the criticism Tuesday. \"I grew up in this district,\" Ossoff said, speaking to CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day.\" \"I grew up in this community. It is my home. My family is still there.\"Ossoff has said he'll move back to the district after his girlfriend finishes medical school nearby. \"It's something I've been very transparent about,\" he said. \"I am proud to be supporting her career. As soon as she finishes her medical training, I will be 10 minutes back up the road where I grew up.\" CNN's Josiah Ryan contributed to this report.",

      "text" : "PARIS — It has almost become routine in France: A terrorist attack shatters the rhythms of daily life, bringing bloodshed and anguish. The assailant turns out to be someone known to the authorities.What is different now is the timing, as Paris is again on high alert, less than 36 hours before the country goes to the polls on Sunday in one of the most tumultuous and unpredictable presidential races in memory.The brazen assault on Thursday by Karim Cheurfi, 39, a French national with a history of violence, left one police officer dead on the sidewalk of the Champs-Élysées.It has also provided a potent opportunity for conservatives, primarily Marine Le Pen, leader of the far right National Front, to use the violence to try to stoke hostility toward immigrants and Muslims, as well as fears about whether citizens can be protected from terrorism.Barely a week ago, with her poll numbers sagging, Ms. Le Pen tried to rally her base with a raw appeal against Muslims and immigrants. It was unclear if her gambit was resonating. Now she and other candidates are jockeying to position themselves as tough on terror, amid revelations that Mr. Cheurfi, like several attackers before him, had been on the authorities’ radar.The Paris prosecutor’s office on Friday acknowledged having opened a preliminary terrorism investigation into Mr. Cheurfi as recently as March 9. He was arrested in February, only to be released for lack of evidence. After Thursday’s attack, the police found kitchen knives, a gun and a Quran in the trunk of the car he was driving, and also pieces of paper with scribbled allegiances to the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attack.Ms. Le Pen pounced, mocking the departing president, François Hollande, and vowing to be an unblinkingly tough leader.“For 10 years, under the governments of left and right, everything has been done to make us losers,” she said, speaking from her party headquarters outside Paris on Friday. “There must be a president who acts and who protects.”But Ms. Le Pen was not the only one who stood to gain. Some analysts predicted that the principal electoral beneficiary could be the embattled mainstream center-right candidate François Fillon, who produced a book last fall called “Defeating Islamic Totalitarianism,” and who also uses harsh rhetoric to depict the antiterrorism fight as a war of civilizations.Mr. Fillon, a former prime minister, and once the presidential front-runner, had languished in polls after becoming entangled in a nepotism scandal that led to embezzlement charges against him. But he has been gaining ground in recent weeks, and the attack might provide a final push.“You can imagine a movement toward one who has held power,” said Dominique Reynié, an expert on the far right who teaches at Sciences Po. “He’s written on terrorism. He’s been prime minister.”“For Marine Le Pen, it won’t have an effect,” Mr. Reynié said. “She’s already at the level she’s reached, partly because of terrorism.”Throughout Friday, the authorities in Paris continued their investigation as more details became known about Mr. Cheurfi, who was killed by the police on Thursday. He had been convicted of crimes four times and spent more than 10 years in prison, most of that time for shooting at police officers during a 2001 robbery, the Paris prosecutor, François Molins, acknowledged at a Friday afternoon news conference.Mr. Cheurfi’s arrest in February was for making anti-police threats, but the authorities lacked sufficient proof to hold him. Asked about his release, Christophe Rouget, a spokesman for one of the main police unions, said, “We live in a state of laws, after all,” citing the lack of probative evidence against him.Even so, the police made Mr. Cheurfi the subject of a preliminary terrorism investigation, Mr. Molins said.“Cheurfi’s criminal record, his trajectory, justified the pursuit of investigations by the antiterrorism branch of my office, within a terrorism context,” he added.A man identified by BFM-TV as Mr. Cheurfi’s lawyer described him as “extremely isolated, a solitary person,” who spent much of his time playing video games. “His development had been blocked,” said the lawyer, Jean-Laurent Panier. “His father and brother were worried about him.”The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Mr. Cheurfi’s neighbors in the Paris suburb of Chelles described him as quiet, and showing no obvious signs of radicalization. “Not very friendly. Fairly proud,” said Augusto Rodriguez, a neighbor.Mr. Cheurfi was not among France’s notorious “S-Files,” the thousands suspected of extremism whom the state is officially surveilling, but does not have enough formal proof to arrest. The S-Files have acquired near-mythic boogeyman status in the French imagination. On Friday, Ms. Le Pen called for their expulsion from the country. At a campaign rally in Marseille earlier in the week, she called them an “immense army of the shadows that wants us to live in terror.”Emboldened after the Champs-Élysées attack, Ms. Le Pen sought, as she often does, to place the antiterrorism fight as a struggle for the French soul. The idea is at the heart of her nationalistic campaign, and even as her momentum has slowed she has still placed first in many polls before the Sunday vote. “France is targeted not for what it does, but for what it is, and the French, for the simple reason that they are French,” Ms. Le Pen said.The French government immediately reacted harshly to Ms. Le Pen’s demands — a measure of how seriously it took the potential boost of Thursday night’s shooting to a party it views as a threat to French democracy.Ms. Le Pen “was seeking, like after every tragedy, to take advantage of it, in order to sow division,” said the prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve. “She’s seeking to shamelessly exploit fear and emotion for exclusively political ends.”In the neighborhood where the attack occurred — a hybrid mix of the raffish and refined, visited by thousands of tourists daily — Ms. Le Pen’s proposals struck a chord. “She’s just gained one point in the polls. At least,” said Christophe Pohls, a barman at a cafe on the Rue de Ponthieu.“When you see what’s going these days, sure, sure, this helps her. She wants to close the frontiers. Pay more attention to what’s going on in France,” said Mr. Pohls, who approved of Ms. Le Pen’s idea of expelling those named the S-Files.His friend Henri Martins, in charge of security at a local nightclub, agreed. “Definitely a happy coincidence for her,” he said, as he vented against what he described as the porousness of the criminal justice system.“They arrest these guys 10 times, then they let them out?” asked Mr. Martins, an ex-policeman. “Come on. For sure, this is going to pull up her score.”The attack occurred on Thursday night, and on Friday morning people in the neighborhood were still recovering.“Hallucinatory. First, three shots, then four. We were in the middle of cooking, and we had to stop,” said Jean-François Desloovere, a cook at La Casita on the Rue Washington, just around the corner. “The minute you saw people running, you knew what was up.” He recalled looking down the normally packed Champs-Élysées “and it was totally empty,” with pedestrians pressing themselves against storefronts, “like flies stuck against the glass.”At Le Carpaccio, on the Rue de Berri, customers heard the bursts of gunfire, saw people running in panic down the busy street, and dived to the ground. “They went down on the ground, and broke all the glasses,” said Jamila Maachaoui, who was sweeping up the shards on Friday morning.",

The kids get needed items (clothes, bikes, books, etc.) and $200 for the party or a big gift. We want to teach our kids the value of money and how to budget. So the kids can get a sleepover or blow-out water park trip. My eldest saved up to get a brand-new gaming system and TV, one that he doesn’t want to share with his little brothers. My husband just wants peace, and I am hesitant to push either way. I am the oldest of five and have firm memories of my private property being wrecked by the younger siblings. (Don’t ask about my first car.) I don’t want to just blindly react either. My younger boys blew their birthdays on expensive outings while my eldest really saved up for this. (We refuse to buy video games for presents.) Can you help? —Uncheerful Giver Subscribe to Prudie! Socks and underwear only. Just this once. But socks and underwear all around this year—no excluding others, no horse-trading, no starved materialism. This will teach your children the value of socks and underwear. Resist the urge to make your kids look back on their childhoods as one interminable lesson on short-term gratification versus long-term gain at the expense of all human love and comfort, as you apparently do yours. * * * Advertisement Dear Prudence, Two years ago I got divorced. My ex-husband, who has bipolar disorder, kept many important details about his medical history from me (including past hospitalizations and horrible things he had done while manic) until after we got married. A year after our wedding, he secretly went off of his medication and ended up in full-blown psychosis. This was a horrific time, and his refusal to acknowledge it in any way, even after the fact, ultimately ended our marriage. His family was extremely unhelpful and blamed me for not protecting him from stress. I was able to protect my children from my previous marriage during this episode but was unwilling to risk another. I am still picking up the pieces from this experience. I have just learned he is engaged to a young woman with four young children of her own. I am willing to bet she has not been told the full extent of his illness, nor the reason for our divorce. I feel she needs to know but I also have my own children to protect. Am I under a moral obligation to tell her? If so, how? —Want to Warn the Next Wife I’m trying to picture how you could speak with your ex-husband’s new fiancée about the extent of his mental health issues in a way that doesn’t come across as meddling or retaliatory, and I’m not sure that I can. On the one hand, suffering from bipolar disorder should not preclude someone from getting married; on the other hand, your problems with your ex stemmed less from his mental illness than from the ways he deceived you about his mental illness and how he was (or wasn’t) treating it. I think your primary concern should be for yourself and your children, and that any attempts you make to contact this woman will result in, at best, a cold rejection. At worst, the couple might blame you for trying to poison their new marriage and lash out. However, I can understand your fears for her young children. If you still feel a duty to warn her, you should keep the message brief and dispassionate. Stress that you’re not suggesting he is unmarriageable because he has bipolar disorder but that he has a history of not complying with his prescribed treatment without warning, acting out, then refusing to discuss his behavior, and this is what caused your divorce. Then say no more, and be sure to stay far away from your ex and his family. Your primary obligation is to your own. Advertisement * * * Dear Prudence, My boyfriend of six years is refusing to accompany me to a friend’s wedding because an ex who broke up with him 10 years ago will be in the bridal party. From what he says, it was an awful relationship, and its termination was slow and painful and led to the most miserable year of his life. But it happened a decade ago, and he’s moved on (obviously) and become very successful. He says that even seeing her will make him feel anxious and awful and he will be unable to have a good time. Obviously I’m not going to drag him to an event that he will be miserable at, but am I right to be frustrated? –Forget the Past Mildly, I think. Letting go of the past is laudable, but I think we’re all entitled to at least one or two people we refuse to share a room with. It sounds like he’s an otherwise-excellent boyfriend who doesn’t spend much time dwelling on his worst ex, so I give you permission to feel irritated for another three days but no more. Advertisement * * * Dear Prudence, My husband and I have always speculated that our only child may be gay. In high school, he had a few close male friends that he would be very close to for a few months to a year, and then they would disappear and our son would be visibly heartbroken. My husband and I have had marital issues over the years, which I believe has blinded us in some ways to our son and this burden he must be carrying. I feel horrible. Our son is 24 and finishing graduate school. He recently brought a college friend home and it is very obvious there is something going on between them. They shared a room, and we found an empty condom box after their visit. Additionally, both of them are in a relationship on Facebook, originating on the same date, but it does not say with whom. We are absolutely supportive of our son no matter what and want him to know that. How do we go about letting him know that we are his No. 1 fans and are totally accepting of the situation, without making either of them uncomfortable? —Anxious Cheerleaders Advertisement The gay cat is very much out of the gay bag. If you’re supportive of your gay son and you want him to know it, tell him you loved meeting his boyfriend and you’re very happy that he’s out. Go ahead and use the word boyfriend, not “It was so nice to see that you’ve … found someone” or “Your friend seemed so nice.” Your son had boyfriends in high school, not “close male friends who made him sad when they disappeared,” and he has a boyfriend now. There is a very simple solution to your particular problem. It doesn’t make gay people uncomfortable when you acknowledge that we’re gay. It makes us uncomfortable when people try to dance around the subject. Don’t wait for your son to take the lead on this—you know what’s going on, and you’re happy for him, so acting like you’re not picking up what he’s putting down might make him think you wouldn’t approve if he came out and said it. If it’s very obvious there’s something going on between your son and his boyfriend, acknowledge the obvious. Celebrate the obvious. Congratulate him on the obvious. Ask him how things are going with the obvious. I think you’ll all feel incredibly relieved when you do. * * * Dear Prudence, There’s a summer internship I’m really interested in at an LGBT archive near my parents’ house. (I’m in college.) Thing is, I’m not really out to my parents. I sort of broached the subject with my mother a few years ago, but she didn’t react well and we never mentioned it again. (She never told my dad.) Both of my parents are nonhomophobic in theory (they never use slurs or condone other people’s homophobia), but I guess her daughter being gay hit too close to home. I don’t think they’d kick me out or withdraw financial support, but coming out would be awkward and uncomfortable. I could probably find an apartment for the summer, but given how close they are to the archive, that seems like a waste of money and I’d still feel obligated to tell them what I’m doing, so the only problem that would solve is giving me some space. I hate the idea of not applying to a program that I’m really excited about just because I don’t want to deal with coming out. If I got the job, not telling them about it isn’t really realistic. I’m out to my brother, who’s pretty supportive and (as far as I know) will also be home this summer. I guess the subtext of all of this is that I’m pissed that my parents, who pride themselves on being so progressive and liberal, wouldn’t be happy with my being gay. —Resentful in the Closet I think you should come out to them now. My stance holds: In the previous letter, it was the parents who had something they wanted to say but were keeping back, and here it’s you in the same position. Summer is still a few months away (and there’s always a possibility you won’t get the internship), so your parents will have some time to digest the news and settle down before you’re home for vacation. Your mother didn’t respond very well the first time you tried to come out, so don’t “sort of broach” the subject this time. Tell both your parents that you’re gay. Enlist your brother’s help if you need some moral support. If the worst thing you have to fear is some awkwardness, you might as well get it over with, because you’re not getting any less gay. The sooner you come out, the sooner your parents can come around. * * * Dear Prudence,\nI have a wonderful boyfriend of over a year, and I’m convinced he’s the one. However, we’ve had an on-and-off issue where he gets uncomfortable whenever I go out without him. This isn’t a frequent problem, but once or twice a month I’ll go out to a bar for happy hour or a girls’ night out. I know that he trusts me, but he always texts while I’m out asking if there are lots of guys wherever I am and if they’re hitting on me. The other day, my friend was running late to an after-work happy hour and he insisted on meeting me there to “keep me company” until she arrived, but I know his motive was to make sure no one hit on me as a single woman at the bar. I know where this is coming from, as he was blindsided when his ex cheated on him years ago, subsequently ending the relationship. He went to therapy afterward, but clearly this issue still manifests itself in his insecurity when I go out alone. This isn’t a deal-breaker for me, but is there anything I can do to try to lessen these “protective” measures? —On a Short Leash I don’t think your boyfriend trusts you at all, and I can’t figure out why the fact that he thinks you can’t leave his sight twice a month without cheating on him isn’t a deal-breaker for you. If it’s not a red flag, it’s definitely burnt orange. If this controlling behavior isn’t enough for you to break up with him, tell him that you love him and you’re not going to cheat on him, but you’re also not going to indulge his paranoia the next time you go out with friends. If he texts you while you’re out, ignore it. He can survive a few hours alone, and if he tries to make you feel otherwise, or that you’re somehow responsible for the fact that he was cheated on in the past, please know that you’re being manipulated. Something tells me he won’t be able to let it go, and you’re going to have to decide if you’re willing to put up with his jealous text messages and his subsequent tantrums when you won’t indulge him and his driving to the bar just to “check in” on you. I hope I don’t hear from you again in a year or two because he’s escalated his controlling behavior, but that’s very much the road he seems to be dragging you down. I think you should leave him sooner rather than later. * * * Dear Prudence,\nI recently ended a yearlong relationship after my boyfriend became physically violent. I have learned a lot about the mental gymnastics I put myself through to stay in the relationship, but I am finding it very hard to objectively decide if I should report him to my university for domestic violence. The assaults weren’t severe but they did happen multiple times. He also once destroyed my property and physically prevented me from exiting a car. I want to report him to create a record and prevent this from happening again, but I worry that I might be overreacting. I don’t want to ruin his life, but I don’t want to further minimize his actions. —To File or Not You are not trying to ruin your ex-boyfriend’s life. You are merely acknowledging reality. I encourage you to file a report both with the police and with your university, keeping in mind that neither institution has a spotless track record when it comes to supporting victims of domestic violence and assault and may very likely not lead to an arrest or any formal consequences for your ex. As you note, creating a record is important. You are not trying to retaliate or hurt him the way he hurt you. He took steps toward ruining his own life the day he raised his hand against you. * * * Dear Prudence,\nAs it has come up occasionally over the years, I wondered: What is your take on the “can you complain to your neighbors about hearing them have sex” topic? Generally, advice seems to be no, but I was just wondering if there are any circumstances that make it appropriate (time of day/night, day of week, repeat offenders, etc.)? For what it’s worth, I’m the complaint receiver (rarely happens), not the complainer, and I always have a mental battle over feeling like they just need to deal with it versus needing to make everyone happy and not be objectionable in any way in case they complain to landlord. What’s your take? Do I apologize? Ignore them? Change habits? Thanks! —Too Loud? Very happy to make an official ruling here. If someone is having sex in their own home or apartment, they have discharged their duties as citizens not to have sex in your home or in the hallway right in front of your door. Unless they’re doing it right in front of an open window or screaming directly into your voicemail, there’s no way you can tell other human beings they can’t have sex on their own property just because it makes you uncomfortable. There is no time of day or day of the week where it is inappropriate to have sex. My only amendment to the rule is as follows: If you live in an apartment building and your neighbors are violating quiet hours, it’s OK to bring it up with them or even follow up with a landlord, but treat it like you would any other noise complaint. It’s not especially egregious because it involves genitals. It’s just noise. * * * Discuss this column with Dear Prudence on her Facebook page!

According to Reuters and German investment banks, Apple is putting together a team to design its own battery management chip for the iPhone.By designing its own chips, Apple could go a bit further than the standard power management chip, making the iPhone a bit more efficient when it comes to power usage. This way, the company could beat Android makers when it comes to battery life.\nApple currently works with German supplier Dialog Semiconductor. Dialog told Exane that the company has already designed the power management chips for the next two iPhones in 2017 and 2018 — so don’t expect to see changes any time soon.\nBut things could change in 2019, as Apple could be putting together its own team in Germany. The company has been poaching Dialog engineers to join Apple.\nApple sells tens of millions of iPhones every year. Today’s news could have a big impact on Dialog. That’s why Dialog shares are currently trading down 15 percent.\nIt’s interesting to see that Apple is moving down its supply chain and replacing its most important suppliers one by one.

      "text" : "Officials in the Drumpf administration on Sunday demanded that Russia stop supporting the Syrian government or face a further deterioration in its relations with the United States. Signaling the focus of talks Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will have in Moscow later this week, officials said that Russia, in propping up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, bears at least partial responsibility for Wednesday’s poison gas attack on villagers in Idlib province. “I hope Russia is thinking carefully about its continued alliance with Bashar al-Assad, because every time one of these horrific attacks occurs, it draws Russia closer into some level of responsibility,” Tillerson said on ABC’s This Week. Although officials acknowledged that they have seen no evidence directly linking Russia to the attacks, the top national security adviser, Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, said Russia should be pressed to answer what it knew ahead of the chemical attack since it has placed warplanes and air defense systems with associated troops in Syria since 2015. “I think what we should do is ask Russia, how could it be, if you have advisers at that airfield, that you didn’t know that the Syrian air force was preparing and executing a mass murder attack with chemical weapons,” McMaster said on Fox News. The timing of the comments, with Tillerson heading soon to Moscow, signaled the administration’s intent to pressure Russia to step away from Assad, who is supported by the Kremlin with military aid and diplomatic cover. The fallout from the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons on civilians, plus the U.S. missile strike that came in retaliation for it, adds more strain to a rocky relationship that is at its lowest point in decades. A host of issues are responsible, topped by suspected Russian attempts to interfere in the U.S. presidential election and Moscow’s support for separatists in Ukraine that have prompted U.S. and European sanctions. These topics have now been overshadowed by last week’s missile strike. The Russians had hoped that relations with the United States might improve under President Drumpf, who expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign. Tillerson’s nomination as secretary of state also raised prospects. given the former ExxonMobil executive’s experience negotiating a major deal with Rosneft, the state-controlled oil giant. But 11 weeks into Drumpf’s presidency, expectations have been substantially lowered. “This is a big cold shower,” said Samuel Charap, a Russia analyst with the Rand Corp. “Even if behind closed doors they might engage on other issues in a more pragmatic manner, the public posture is going to be one of emphasizing how they disagree about [Syria]. Putin is not going to want to be seen as chummy with the U.S. secretary of state.” On Sunday, both Tillerson and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley cast doubts on Assad’s legitimacy as Syria’s leader. Haley said that eventually the unrest in Syria cannot end if Assad remains in power. “In no way do we see peace in that area with Russia covering up for Assad,” Haley said. “And in no way do we see peace in that area with Assad at the head of the Syrian government.” Tillerson noted other instances when Syrian forces deployed chemical weapons, and other attacks on civilians involving barrel bombs and conventional weapons. “I think the issue of how Bashar al-Assad’s leadership is sustained, or how he departs, is something that we’ll be working [on] with allies and others in the coalition,” said Tillerson, who after weeks of keeping a low profile was making his debut on the Sunday talk shows. “But I think with each of those actions, he really undermines his own legitimacy.” Neither suggested Assad’s demise was imminent. “Once the ISIS threat has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria,” Tillerson said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” The U.S. missile strikes in Syria carry the implicit threat of a larger U.S. role in the conflict. Tillerson said Sunday that they function as a warning to any country acting outside of international norms, in an apparent reference to North Korea. “At least in the short run, it will further complicate efforts to improve the U.S.-Russia bilateral relationship, which seemed to be Tillerson’s objective in going to Moscow,” said Jeffrey Mankoff, a Russia analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “In the longer term, the threat of further U.S. intervention is a card that the U.S. can play to get the Russians to tighten the screws on Assad — on both the chemical weapons and possibly on accepting a political deal with the opposition.” Tillerson departed around dawn Sunday for Italy to attend a meeting of the G-7 nations, a bloc of industrialized democracies. He is due to arrive late Tuesday in Russia for his first visit as secretary of state. He and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are scheduled to meet, but it is not known if the secretary of state will also see Putin, who personally bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2012. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said the Russians still hold out hope for a breakthrough, but that depends on whether Putin and Drumpf hit it off, not on anything Tillerson and Lavrov say. “Things will only happen as a result of direct personal, sustained contact between Putin and Drumpf,” McFaul said. “That’s the way things work with Putin.” world national-security Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Checkpoint newsletter Military, defense and security at home and abroad.

Should the Drumpf administration ease sanctions imposed over Ukraine, for instance, critics would label it payback for Russia’s pre-election hacks targeting Democrats. Several analysts said Assad has humiliated Putin by using chemical weapons despite Russia’s guarantee that Syria’s stockpiles would be whisked away. Moscow’s interest in getting sanctions eased is greater than its loyalty to Assad. And that could provide maneuvering room for Tillerson. That appears to be Tillerson’s calculation, too. “I do not believe that the Russians want to have worsening relationships with the U.S.,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” “But it’s going to take a lot of discussion and a lot of dialogue to better understand what is the relationship that Russia wishes to have with the U.S.” Mike DeBonis and Abby Philip contributed to this report.",

(Reuters) Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez was found dead inside his prison cell in an apparent suicide on April 19, according to the Massachusetts state Department of Corrections. Former U.S. football star Aaron Hernandez was found dead inside his prison cell in an apparent suicide on April 19. (Reuters) Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end who was serving a life sentence for murder without the possibility of parole, hanged himself in his prison cell early Wednesday morning, Massachusetts Department of Corrections officials say. Officers at the Souza Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Mass., found Hernandez, 27, hanging from a bedsheet at about 3:05 a.m. Wednesday. They attempted lifesaving techniques on the former Pro Bowl player and he was taken to UMass Memorial Health Alliance Hospital in Leominster, where he was pronounced dead. Christopher Fallon, the deputy commissioner of communications for the Massachusetts Department of Corrections, told The Post in an email that Hernandez, who was in a single cell in general population housing, attached the sheet to his cell window and tried to block his door by “jamming it with various items.” He added that Massachusetts State Police were present and an investigation is ongoing. sports early-lead Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

See all newsletters [A look back at the murder trial of Aaron Hernandez] Hernandez’s death ends a stunning fall from the golden life of a star athlete and comes on the day the Patriots visit the White House to celebrate their victory in Super Bowl LI. The team, which cut him only hours after his June 2013 arrest for the murder of Odin Lloyd, and his former teammates have had very little comment on his downfall and a Patriots spokesman said Wednesday that he did not anticipate the club commenting. Last week, Coach Bill Belichick, in a CNBC word-association interview, used the word “tragic” to describe Hernandez. After Hernandez’s arrest in 2013, Belichick said, “It’s a sad day. It’s really a sad day on so many levels. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, with the victim. I express my sympathy with everyone that’s been impacted. A young man has lost his life, a family has suffered a tragic loss.” The murder of Lloyd occurred less than a year after he signed a seven-year, $40 million contract extension with the Patriots that included a $12.5 million bonus, the highest ever for a tight end. He had been a steal for the Patriots, falling to the fourth round of the NFL draft because of concerns about his maturity and the people with whom he associated. “He was really intelligent, and that’s why he was such a pain in the [butt],” a former University of Florida staffer told NFL.com in 2014. “He knew how to beat the system on everything.” As pro teams considered whether drafting him was worth the risk, then-coach Urban Meyer and his staff warned that it was “crucial that Hernandez be surrounded by the right people,” according to NFL.com. The coaches tried to keep him from returning home to Connecticut and worried when his friends there came to Gainesville on game weekends. A little less than a week ago, he was acquitted in a double murder trial but was convicted of a gun possession charge. There was a brief, sweet moment during that trial when Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez, his fiancee, brought the couple’s 4-year-old daughter to the courtroom and the two exchanges waves. For a brief moment, he smiled broadly and his face lit up.",

      "text" : "Nick Viall and Vanessa Grimaldi. Photo: Eric McCandless/ABC via Getty Images  Getting engaged on The Bachelor certainly doesn’t mean you’re going to live happily ever after, but even the show’s most implausible couples usually pretend to tolerate each other for the first couple of months (at least until the spon-con well starts to dry up). Not so for recent finalists Nick Viall and Vanessa Grimaldi, who have made it their mission to disabuse us of any fairy-tale illusions we may still harbor about the show’s matchmaking efficacy. Turns out, creating a lasting partnership is a little more difficult than making it through eight weeks of televised date nights, and the new couple have used their post-show interviews to manage fans’ expectations about their relationship and remind us all how “tough,” “difficult,” and “challenging” reality-TV romance can be (can’t wait til these two start navigating the U.S. visa process). It may not be a fairy tale, but hey, at they’re “being realistic” and “not sugarcoating” anything. Here are some of the euphemisms they have used to describe their journey: “It’s been good, I mean, you know, I’m not going to sugarcoat things. Some days are tougher than others.” — Vanessa “Vanessa and I have never really pretended, even since After the Final Rose, of trying to be that perfect couple. We’ve been pretty up front of the challenges that come with meeting in Bachelor world — it’s not the ideal experience.” – Nick “I think we both went in it wanting to be honest and open about couples …sometimes things can get tough.” – Vanessa (responding to allegations that they were ‘awkward’ on After the Final Rose) “Relationships are hard in general in life, most relationships fail in the real world and lately the Bachelor’s had a pretty good run, and we also recognize that we took a leap of faith and it’s not ideal and so far our relationship has been anything but.” — Nick “I think I treated this relationship as if it was a real relationship — in a very unrealistic world.” — Vanessa “She’s very much looking forward for this to be over. It was very difficult for us as a couple at the end.” — Nick (on dating on the show) “The reality is — we joke about it, but it’s true — we don’t know what it’s like to go to the movies together, we don’t know what it’s like to spend time together in the real world. Our relationship has been based off of stressful situations.” — Nick “It’s been hard. We live in two different countries, starting a relationship where we don’t get the chance to see each other every day and do normal things … I love him, we love each other, but there have been days that have been difficult.” — Vanessa “Any relationship you’re in, you want to make it work. We know we have a long way to go, but we’re still realistic. We’re still getting to know each other. That’s the reality.” — Nick “Like any relationship, you have your ups and downs. Although we had tough conversations, we had a lot of fun and light conversations. So it was important for me to know we would be able to get past those hard conversations.” — Vanessa (on their tumultuous onscreen relationship) “We have not discussed wedding plans yet. We’re going to first figure out where we want to have dinner together as a couple and things like that. We’re very realistic and we don’t pretend that we knew each other for a year before we got engaged, that’s not our situation.” — Nick “We are taking baby steps.” — Vanessa (on planning their future) “I was dating 29 other women at first … [Then] it was long-distance at first and then we had to relive that entire process together [on TV], which is difficult and challenging … We just decided to be upfront about those hurdles that I think every Bachelor couple before us has faced, and we just didn’t feel the need to sugarcoat it.” — Nick “I don’t think any relationship is perfect.” — Vanessa “We’ve been pretty upfront about having a lot of things to work on, and we’re excited about doing that. So we don’t feel any pressure like that. We’re just kind of doing our own thing.” — Nick Best of luck to these two lovebirds.",

Geils Band, has died, police in Groton, Massachusetts, said.Police came to Geils' home for a well-being check, police Chief Donald Palma said. The 71-year-old was found unresponsive and was declared dead at the scene.Police are investigating the death as a standard procedure. Foul play was not suspected and a preliminary investigation suggests Geils died of natural causes, Palma said.The J. Geils Band was one of the most popular American touring bands of the 1970s.

      "text" : "President Trump did more than retaliate for Bashar al-Assad’s illegal and inhumane use of nerve agents against civilians when he ordered the launch of 59 Tomahawk missiles to destroy al-Shayrat airbase in Syria. He also detonated a few shibboleths of his predecessor’s foreign policy. First is the idea that President Obama’s 2013 deal to remove Assad’s weapons of mass destruction was a success. Susan Rice and John Kerry have lauded the agreement with Russia to supervise the extraction and destruction of Assad’s weapons stockpiles as recently as the last year. But Assad’s brazen attack on civilians in Idlib Province exposed their celebrations as premature. Trump’s swift, decisive, and limited response ended more than a half decade of vacillation toward’s Assad’s behavior. Obama diplomacy failed, but hard power may yet deter Assad from using weapons banned for almost a century. The second casualty of the U.S. strike was the absurd Obama line that the only alternatives available to a president are inaction on one hand and a massive ground invasion and occupation on the other. Obama and the architects of his echo chamber would slam any advocate of military measures as a bloodthirsty warmonger ready to repeat the worst mistakes of the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. But the reality has always been that there are a range of intermediary steps America can take to pursue her objectives and enforce the standards of Western civilization. The destruction of al-Shayrat is an example of coercive diplomacy similar to the airstrikes President Reagan deployed against Muammar Qaddafi and President Clinton deployed against Slobodan Milosevic. The immediate aim is punitive, to deter the further use of nerve gas against civilians. The longer-term goal is to remove Assad from power and reach a settlement that would in all likelihood partition Syria into sectarian zones of influence. Both objectives are impossible through diplomacy alone. Only through the introduction of force might we frighten the Syrians and their supporters into giving up Assad — if not the Alawite power structure — and winding down his war machine. EDITORIAL: Syria After the Airstrikes Which brings us to the final straw man Trump lit on fire. When President Obama punted on Syria in 2013, he claimed there was no international support for limited intervention. True, David Cameron lost a vote in Parliament on the matter. But the actual powers Obama didn’t want to offend were Iran and Russia. He worried they would scuttle the Iran nuclear deal as payback. The loss of American credibility, the confidence of allies, and Syrian civilians were all factored into the cost of an Iranian promise not to test a bomb for 10 years. (function($))(jQuery); Well, the rapprochement with Iran, if it ever existed, is over. In recent weeks President Trump has met with the leaders of our traditional Sunni allies: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan. He has signed off on aid to Saudi in its war against Iranian proxies in Yemen. He has approved weapons to Bahrain, which is worried about Iranian influence over its Shiite population. America is heavily involved in Iraq and Syria. And now, by striking Assad, President Trump has targeted Iran’s most prominent servant. Where things go from here is anyone’s guess. One of the reasons I urged Congress not to support Obama’s airstrikes in 2013 was worry not only over the president’s ambivalence but also possible escalation. Presidential ambivalence is gone, but my worry remains. I do think that this operation was about the best one could hope for: the message and objective was clear, the focus limited, the force overwhelming, support broad and deep. Assad may think twice before using these deadly agents again. Russia may be more inclined to replace him with one of his generals. But it is still worth thinking through possible responses if Assad crosses one of President Trump’s many lines again.

      "text" : "Michelle Obama, center, on stage in Orlando with Robert A. Ivy, left, and Thomas Vonier, of the American Institute of Architects, whose annual conference marked the former first lady’s paid speaking debut Thursday. (Gerardo Mora/Getty Images) ORLANDO — When Barack and Michelle Obama left the White House, they both spoke longingly of a break from life in the public eye. But following a months-long vacation, they have started to tap into the lucrative paid-speaking circuit that has enriched so many other former presidents and first ladies — with the potential to quickly net millions of dollars. On Thursday, both made their first appearances as speakers-for-hire. “Hi everybody, it’s good to get out of the house,” said Michelle Obama, visibly relaxed, as she sat for a wide-ranging — but free of partisan politics — question-and-answer session before the American Institute of Architecture’s annual conference. Her husband, meanwhile, joined historian Doris Kearns Goodwin in New York for a closed-door address to employees of the A&E cable network. It was not divulged how much they were paid for these first appearances. But the former president will collect $400,000 for a September speech to a health-care conference sponsored by investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, Fox Business reported this week. As newly minted high-dollar speakers, the Obamas follow a well-worn path from the White House — but one that poses risks to a personal and political brand rooted in their middle-class backgrounds. Aides to the Obamas would not comment on how much they are charging for other private speaking engagements, but they defended the speaking schedule and pointed out that the president’s first public meeting was a conversation with college students in Chicago earlier this week. “President Obama will deliver speeches from time to time. Some of those speeches will be paid, some will be unpaid, and regardless of venue or sponsor, President Obama will be true to his values, his vision and his record,” his senior adviser, Eric Schultz, said in a statement issued after the Cantor Fitzgerald speech drew a wave of criticism — including a New York Post headline that dubbed Obama “Wall Street’s new fat cat.” Schultz argued that Obama’s appearance at the health-care conference made sense: “As a president who successfully passed health insurance reform, it’s an issue of great importance to him.” As for a six-figure check signed by an investment bank, “I’d just point out that in 2008, Barack Obama raised more money from Wall Street than any candidate in history — and still went on to successfully pass and implement the toughest reforms on Wall Street since FDR.” [What’s on Michelle Obama’s mind? Meet the speechwriter who puts it into words.] Other former first couples have been challenged on their paid speeches, which began in earnest when former president Gerald R. Ford hit the lecture circuit: He needed to make a living somehow, he said. Former president Ronald Reagan was roundly criticized when he followed suit, taking heat for accepting $2 million for two speeches in Japan. “He was seen as a gung-ho patriotic American, and then the first thing he does is go speak to another country that was, in a sense, an economic rival,” said Lance Strate, a professor of communication at Fordham University. “They are entitled to make money, and nobody really bats an eyelash over the book deals they might get. But there’s something about speaking fees because it involves personal presence. As a former president, you’re still representing the country.” Robert Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who was chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said that “as private citizens [the Obamas] are pretty much free to give speeches in their personal capacity,” but at a potential cost to their popularity and future political influence. His old boss did it, too. According to Robert Draper’s book “Dead Certain,” Bush said the lecture circuit would “replenish the ol’ coffers.” He was reportedly paid between $100,000 and $175,000 for each appearance. Bill and Hillary Clinton similarly came under heavy criticism for their private speeches, which earned them more than $25 million for delivering 104 speeches over 15 months, and became an issue in her presidential campaigns. “It’s not a question of whether it’s legal,” Painter said. “It’s a question of whether someone in a political environment can make an argument that it was unethical.” [In Chicago, Obama tells young leaders that ‘special interests dominate the debates in Washington’] Though neither of the Obamas seem to want to run for political office in the future, their calculations are complicated by the tenuous state of the Democratic Party, said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. “In a party that doesn’t really have especially captivating personalities right now, he remains a figure­head,” Zelizer said. “If he goes down the road of speaking for a lot of money, that has the potential to hurt the party.” Obama seems to be attempting a balance between community-minded appearances and lucrative ones. His first paid event followed a public one Monday at the University of Chicago on civic engagement — typical, his spokesman said, of the topics he wants to discuss in the future. “He wants to get together with young people and other community leaders who are front of mind to him and get ideas from them on how to create solutions for their communities and also partnering with other organizations that are making it a priority to bring resources to communities in need,” said his press secretary, Kevin Lewis. Up next: a speech in Boston next month, where he will receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, and trips to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italy for the Global Food Innovation Summit. [Michelle Obama is quietly planning her next act] As for Michelle Obama, she will speak next month at the Partnership for a Healthier America, which supported her White House anti-obesity initiatives, and join MTV for a “College Signing Day” encouraging high school students to pursue higher education. Both Obamas are represented on the speaking circuit by the Harry Walker Agency, which also reps Richard B. Cheney, Al Gore, and former U.N. secretary general Kofi Annan. Strate said Michelle Obama’s first appearance seemed like a shrewd choice. Architecture “is not terribly controversial. It is something that has both a practical and an artistic element to it,” he said. Onstage in Orlando, the former first lady said she chose the AIA gathering in part because of her early-career work in economic development for the city of Chicago. “I got to know how important architects are in the lifeblood and beauty of any city, particularly a city like Chicago. . . . So [this] seemed like a good place to get started,” she said. “It’s like coming almost full circle for me.” lifestyle style true Today's Headlines newsletter The day's most important stories.

She also seemed to be keeping up with the political news, making indirect comments, in a discussion of the challenges facing cities, that seemed to address President Trump’s proposal for overhauling the nation’s tax code. “We have to invest,” she said, “which means we have to pay taxes.” In another oblique reference, she shared a story about her emotional final day at the White House. Her daughters were in tears as they said goodbye to the staff, and she felt herself choke up, too — but she resolved to keep her emotions hidden before the Inauguration Day cameras. “I didn’t want to have tears in my eyes because people would swear I was crying because of the new president,” she said, as the crowd laughed.",

      "text" : "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during his meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir in Washington on March 23. (Sait Serkan Gurbuz/AP) Fewer than a hundred days into the Trump administration, there are two, actually three, competing narratives about how the government is being run. The first narrative is the Trump administration’s claim that things are running so, so smoothly. A brief glance at the poll numbers suggests that not many people are buying this, so we can discard it quickly. The second narrative, made by the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board among many others, is that America’s system of checks and balances turns out to be working pretty well. President Trump’s more egregious moves have been checked by federal courts and even by the court of public opinion at times. A historically unpopular and costly health-care bill did not pass the House of Representatives, which seems like the right outcome. Irresponsible foreign policy statements made by the president during the transition have been walked back. Efforts by the Trump White House to deny or scuttle investigations into foreign meddling into the election have resulted in congressional investigations, pushback by the intelligence community and recusals by Trump appointees. The administration successfully managed to pick a Supreme Court nominee who is not a laughingstock. There’s a lot to this argument. But if I may, I’d like to proffer just a sampling of the news stories that have broken in the past 24 hours to suggest a third and more troubling narrative: the president and his acolytes are beclowning the American state. Think I’m exaggerating? Consider the following: 1) Shane Harris, Carol Lee, and Julian Barnes, “Mike Flynn Offers to Testify in Exchange for Immunity,” Wall Street Journal. Mike Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, has told the Federal Bureau of Investigation and congressional officials investigating the Trump campaign’s potential ties to Russia that he is willing to be interviewed in exchange for a grant of immunity from prosecution, according to officials with knowledge of the matter. Let’s just stop to appreciate the fact that stories like these normally appear in year seven of an administration, not day 70. The granting of immunity does not automatically mean that the person has committed a felony. But as a former high-ranking national security official once put it, “When you are given immunity, that means you probably committed a crime.” That former high-ranking national security official was Michael Flynn in the fall of 2016. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn is offering to cooperate with congressional investigators in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Here's what he and President Donald Trump said about immunity in 2016. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) 2) Shane Goldmacher, Matthew Nussbaum, Tara Palmeri, and Alex Isenstadt, “White House shuffles West Wing staff after health bill collapse,” Politico. Less than a week after suffering a stinging defeat on health care legislation, President Donald Trump shook up his West Wing staff on Thursday, dispatching one of his top aides to shore up an outside political group that the White House believes failed to support Trump’s agenda at a critical juncture. It’s worth noting that, less than a hundred days into the Trump administration, the White House has sent its first national security adviser packing, a few lower-level NSC staffers have been forced out, a key communications official, and now Packer — who is leaving to shore up a listing outside political group. So who’s left to mind the store? I’m glad you asked. 3) Vanessa Williams, “Omarosa Manigault is in Trump’s White House because of her loyalty. But what is she doing there?” Washington Post. If her devotion explains how Manigault wound up in Trump’s White House as the highest-ranking African American in the West Wing, it is far less easy to explain exactly what she’s doing there. Some African American political insiders already have concluded that she is ineffective, and she is routinely derided on social media as simply providing cover for a president deeply unpopular with African Americans. Some black Republicans were particularly critical of the Trump administration’s handling of the HBCU initiative, which included a White House meeting with the school officials that some viewed as little more than a photo op for the president … Armstrong Williams, another longtime Republican strategist and close adviser to [Ben] Carson, said Manigault’s influence goes beyond “the so-called black agenda.” He said Manigault has input on press secretary Sean Spicer’s daily briefings and that “she carries a lot of weight” with candidates seeking ambassadorships. Just so I’m clear on this: aspiring ambassadors need to develop good ties with Omarosa Manigault? As Trump’s coterie of White House advisers has shrunk, others will be shouldering more responsibilities. Which leads us to … 4) Emma Loop, “White House Sends Jared Kushner To Meet With Top Senators On Improving The Criminal Justice System,” BuzzFeed. Jared Kushner, son-in-law and senior adviser to President Donald Trump, has been dispatched by the White House to discuss criminal justice reform issues with key senators, BuzzFeed News has learned. Kushner met with Sens. Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin on Capitol Hill Thursday. Again, let’s just stop for a second and consider the fact that the person described by himself as “first among equals” in the White House has been given the lead on U.S. relations with Canada, Mexico, China and the Middle East, has also been asked to run a White House Office of American Innovation, and will now also apparently be running point on improving the criminal justice system. This is a person whose prior background suggests no particular competence in any of these areas of government. His only qualification for White House service appears to be that he married well. You would think that the foreign policy issues could be better handled by the secretary of state. You would think that, but … 5) Anne Gearan and Carol Morello, “Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spends his first weeks isolated from an anxious bureaucracy,” Washington Post. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson takes a private elevator to his palatial office on the seventh floor of the State Department building, where sightings of him are rare on the floors below. On many days, he blocks out several hours on his schedule as “reading time,” when he is cloistered in his office poring over the memos he prefers ahead of in-person meetings. Most of his interactions are with an insular circle of political aides who are new to the State Department. Many career diplomats say they still have not met him, and some have been instructed not to speak to him directly — or even make eye contact. On his first three foreign trips, Tillerson skipped visits with State Department employees and their families, embassy stops that were standard morale-boosters under other secretaries of state. Nothing to see here, just someone whose primary job in government is to talk to other people being averse to … talking to other people. Which is, to be fair, consistent with everything we have learned about Tillerson to date. What’s breathtaking about this list is that I haven’t even gotten to the White House officials leaking information to Devin Nunes or Nunes lying about his sources to reporters or the president’s moronic tweets. And, to repeat myself, all of this has happened in the last day. All new administrations make mistakes and have staff who don’t work out. The pace of errors in this administration, however, is unprecedented. No wonder Michael Gerson’s assessment of this administration’s performance is, “a pretty bad combination: empty, easily distracted, vindictive, shallow, impatient, incompetent and morally small. This is not the profile of a governing party.” No wonder Peggy Noonan has concluded: Looking at the administration 70 days in, things do not, in these areas, look promising. There’s too much gravitational pull to the president’s accumulated mistakes. His stupid tweets have now resulted in the Russia probe. That will help opioid addicts in Ohio. This Thursday he may have launched a Republican civil war: The Freedom Caucus had better “get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & the Dems, in 2018!” That will help promote harmony. His staff has failed to absorb the obvious fact that Mr. Trump was so outsized, colorful, and freakish a character that their primary job, and an easy one it was, was to be the opposite — sober, low-key, reassuring. Instead they seemed to compete with him for outlandishness … Crisis reveals the character, the essential nature of a White House. Seventy days in, that is my worry. The American system of government has checked Trump’s worst impulses. He has so many bad instincts, however, that not all of them will get checked. The burn rate of his staff is extraordinarily high, and there is no evidence that his remaining acolytes really know how to govern. We are 70 days into an administration that has nearly 1,400 more days in office. Think of the screw-ups that await us. Last month Trump’s chief political strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, told CPAC that he was engaged in a daily fight for the “deconstruction of the administrative state.” He might very well succeed in that fight — not through cunning, but through epic levels of incompetence.",

      "text" : "A man arrested in the stabbing death of an artist who was found tied up in her basement apartment on Capitol Hill did not know the victim, according to D.C. police, while court documents suggest she may have been targeted in a robbery. The suspect, El Hadji Alpha Madiou Toure, 28, was apprehended Monday on Hamlin Street in Brookland. Police described him as homeless and living in District shelters, although he had a Maryland driver’s license and appears to have family living in Laurel. At the time of his arrest he was wanted on a charge of violating probation in a robbery conviction in Tennessee, and he has an extensive criminal record in Georgia with convictions for making a terrorist threat, assault and ­robbery. Toure was charged in the District with first-degree murder while armed and theft in the death of Corrina Mehiel, 34, whose body was found the afternoon of March 21 in a back room of a rowhouse in the 600 block of 14th Street NE, near the H Street corridor. She lived in North Carolina but had been in the District for months as she worked on an exhibit at the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design. “We’re relieved a man is in custody,” said the victim’s stepmother, Lari Mehiel, 58, who lives in Seattle. A memorial service was held Sunday in Glenville, Pa., near the Hanover home of her maternal grandparents.

Police charge El Hadji Alpha Madiou Toure with first-degree murder in the death of Corrina Mehiel. (WUSA9) Toure appeared in D.C. Superior Court on Tuesday with his ankles and wrists in shackles and wearing a white plastic jumpsuit. A judge ordered him jailed until his next hearing April 11. Toure’s attorney, Jacqueline Cadman of the Public Defender Service, argued that her client was innocent. “There is no evidence Mr. Toure committed this murder,” Cadman said. She said it was a “huge jump” to link Toure with the killing “just because stolen property may have been found on him.” Cadman said that there was no murder weapon found, no eyewitness and no injuries to Toure. “Mr. Toure was not in that apartment and he did not kill the decedent,” she said. Although robbery remains a possible motive, police say other motives remain under investigation. An arrest affidavit filed in D.C. Superior Court quotes an acquaintance of the suspect telling another person that the defendant “was trying to rob the woman, but was not trying to kill her.” [Visiting artist found slain on Capitol Hill] The affidavit says Toure used Mehiel’s Toyota Prius and repeatedly withdrew money, using her bank card, in increments of $400, $500 and $800 in Maryland and the District. Police said they found paperwork with the suspect showing that he had purchased a Ford Taurus on March 24, the day after Mehiel disappeared, and had made a $1,000 down payment. Police released this image March 24 saying it showed a person of interest in the death of Corrina Mehiel. The person was identified Tuesday as El Hadji Alpha Madiou Toure. (D.C. Police) Police have said Mehiel was at the Corcoran on Sunday, March 19, then went to a dinner party with well-known artist Mel Chin at his apartment in Foggy Bottom. Mehiel texted her boyfriend at 1:24 a.m. on Monday. She was to leave for home in Burnsville, N.C., later that day. Is is unclear when the attack occurred, although video from a home surveillance system shows the suspect standing in front of Mehiel’s home and near her car at 10:13 a.m. Monday, and a man that fits the suspect’s description driving her car at 12:57 p.m., according to the affidavit. The affidavit does not say how the attacker got inside the apartment, although police have said there were no signs of forced entry. Police went to the home about 4:15 p.m. after Mehiel had not returned home to North Carolina as expected and her father could not reach her. A police report says she was found tied with bedding and clothing. The affidavit describes a gruesome scene inside the house. Mehiel had been stabbed in the neck and repeatedly in the body, and a detective wrote that the number of wounds and their severity “suggest some sort of torture had been done to the decedent.” Police also said the victim had defensive wounds on her left hand and palm indicating a struggle. Detectives were eventually able to track the suspect’s movements using surveillance video from private homes on the victim’s block, moving Metro buses as they rolled by Mehiel’s house and electronic license-plate readers. The affidavit says police were able to identify Toure’s SmarTrip card number as he entered and left subway stations, and learned of locations where he allegedly withdrew money in College Park, Beltsville, Elkridge and Hyattsville. local public-safety Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Local Crime & Safety Alerts Breaking news about public safety in and around D.C.

Authorities also released two sets of surveillance photos of a person of interest, who they confirmed on Tuesday is the man they arrested. D.C. interim police chief Peter Newsham, who is awaiting confirmation, said at a news conference that “right now, we do not have a strong motive in the case. We don’t have any information to suggest that the victim knew the suspect.” He also said there is no evidence the victim was sexually assaulted. Newsham credited the arrest to “a tip from the community that was instrumental in closing the case.” Police initially held Toure on the arrest warrant from Tennessee. James E. Bradford Jr., a spokesman for the sheriff's office in Bradley County, Tenn., said Toure pleaded guilty in October 2006 under his birth name, Ellie Brown, to two counts of robbery. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and served one year before being released on probation. A warrant charging him with violating the terms of his probation was filed Thursday.

      "text" : "How fast is fast enough when it comes to clothes and gratification? How much do you really need that dress or bag or platform sandal?I’ve been wondering this since last week, when Farfetch.com announced that it would now be delivering Gucci in 90 minutes in 10 major cities around the world. A customer can “place an order and almost before they have hung up the phone, somebody is knocking on their door with a beautiful bag!” the founder José Neves said with great fanfare when I called to ask about it.I don’t often hear Simon & Garfunkel tunes playing in the back of my mind (unless I am in a Parisian subway and yet another busker is singing “The Boxer”), but now I can’t get the opening line of “The 59th Street Bridge Song” out of my head. “Slow down, you move too fast.” Yadda yadda yadda.Farfetch, Net-a-Porter, Matchesfashion.com and other higher-end retail sites have been offering same-day service in world capitals and vacation destinations for a while now (and Matchesfashion offers 90-minute delivery in London), but the Gucci deal takes it to a whole new level. And while it is, for now, more of a niche offering than a rule, it’s easy to imagine it snowballing to other brands and platforms, as the Great Race for Retail Domination (and Survival) heats up, online and off.“Faster fulfillment” is the mantra of the moment, a response by companies to what has been called the culture of impatience. But I can’t help wondering if at least when it comes to designer fashion — the clothes that define a particular moment in time and often filter down to shape the styles of every day — it’s solving a problem that doesn’t exist. And maybe creating a new one.I understand that we live in a world where, as Mr. Neves pointed out, no one waits for cabs or groceries or tables in restaurants, where information is immediate and pictures go viral. I understand that the millennials and Gen Y-ers are (theoretically) the IWWIWWIWI generations — the “I want what I want when I want it” folks. Conventional wisdom goes that if retailers miss that moment of wanting, they miss the sale. I recognize that defying this seems like the classic behavior of a Luddite. But along the way we have lost some perspective.“Why should we lose face with Amazon?” Mr. Neves said when we were talking. But another question might be: Why should we assume Amazon controls this particular playing field? It may be time to call, well, time on this game of one-upmanship.A handbag is not a bottle of milk for a baby. It’s not a staple. And it’s not necessarily a good idea to create a situation in which it is equated to one. It may not be sustainable, in any sense of the word.Saturday is Earth Day, and in the run-up to the annual reminder of what climate change has wrought, fashion has been as active as always: Kering teamed up with Plug and Play and Fashion for Good, and the Council of Fashion Designers of America has joined forces with Lexus, both to support new businesses focused on responsible supply-chain innovation. But while the industry often equates greenness with materials and manufacturing and also tends to attribute landfill problems to fast fashion of the cheap and disposable kind, it should think about high-end consumption, too.Because in treating investment fashion — which is to say fashion that takes time to create and consumers to understand (and often, desire) — as a commodity, you risk changing how people think about it, and value it, in an essential way. It is true that no one is forcing consumers to opt for the fastest delivery (you can have your jacket in two days if you want, or even a full week), but the sheer fact that the option exists makes the decision seem, somehow, less of a commitment.Besides, just because consumers say they want something — and according to Mr. Neves, timely delivery is the No. 1 criterion for online shopping in every consumer survey Farfetch has done — doesn’t mean it’s a crucial determinant of their behavior.Just consider the recent, somewhat abortive, move to change the fashion show schedule to the “see now, buy now” model. The rationale behind the change was almost exactly the same as the one behind super-speedy delivery: Everyone has a truncated attention span because of Instagram, and if you don’t get a product to customers as soon as they feel desire for it, you miss your window.Yet after only a season, two out of the four main brands experimenting with the idea — Tom Ford and Thakoon — gave it up (Ralph Lauren and Burberry remain exponents). The reason given was that the market wasn’t ready, but had there been a huge and extended spike in demand, the market would presumably have accommodated itself.Indeed, when it comes to investment fashion, as opposed to what we formerly called fast fashion (which perhaps now will have to be rechristened “quick turnover fashion” or some such), there is value in having to wait, which should not be dismissed.By conflating investment fashion with, effectively, groceries, you undermine its claims of specialness, effort and creative muscle — all the criteria on which it is built and which justify, in many ways, its price. You link it to the idea of disposability (which, let’s face it, is the definition of what was normally called fast fashion, a sector in which it is often cheaper to buy a new shirt, say, than to clean the one you already own). If investment suggests value over time, reducing the time reduces the value. Put another way: There is a downside to rushing to fulfill the wants of today; it suggests they may not be the wants of tomorrow.It is happening already: The high-end resale market is booming, with online designer consignment stores like Vestiaire, the RealReal and ThredUP experiencing enormous growth. According to ThredUP’s 2017 fashion resale report (done in conjunction with GlobalData), the fashion resale market is currently worth $18 billion and is expected to grow to $33 billion by 2021, and the average American woman does not wear 60 percent of the pieces in her closet.At a certain point it’s hard not to wonder if all that immediate gratification just adds up to a lot of extraneous stuff. The fact is, it is possible to consume opinion and events (and carrots) without feeling the same need to consume garments. Clothes are signposts of personal communication, and as such they should be long-term acquisitions. Otherwise you risk identity whiplash.Time may be luxury, but we should not assume spending it in anticipation is a waste.",

      "text" : "Putin capitalizes on this. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Bryan R. Smith/Getty Images, Christian Petersen/Getty Images, and John Moore/Getty Images. requirejs([\"jquery\"], function($) ); Last year, one of Donald Trump’s favorite campaign themes was that Americans were being played for suckers. We were “the stupid people,” ripped off by foreigners, immigrants, and refugees. We let them in, they took our money and our jobs, and they raped and killed our people. As president, Trump says he’s fighting back. He’s banned travel from several Muslim-majority countries. He’s set up an office of “Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.” We’re finally getting “smart.” William Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He’s the author of Bearing Right. All this talk about getting smart and standing up to immigrants is a giant con. Trump is part of it, wittingly or not, but the guy pulling the strings is Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. That was the message of Thursday’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Russian interference in the 2016 election: Putin’s propagandists helped Trump, and weakened our country and our alliances, by posing as right-wing Americans and stoking fear of immigrants and minorities. Advertisement Most people who believe Putin interfered in the election think this took the form of backstage collusion. But the witnesses at Thursday’s hearings, who have studied cyber operations and Russian propaganda campaigns, said we’re missing the point: The interference was right out in the open. Several witnesses—including retired Gen. Keith Alexander, who led the National Security Agency from 2005 to 2014—explained to the committee how Russia systematically exploits divisions in the United States and other countries. The exploitation is done by online trolls and bots, synchronized to spread messages and false stories that promote cultural tension. Ethnicity is central to this strategy. In his written statement to the committee, Clinton Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, explained: “Russia targets specific audiences inside electorates amenable to their messages and resulting influence—in particular alt-right audiences incensed over immigration, refugees and economic hardship.” In oral testimony, Watts described how Russian-orchestrated trolls and bots, tracked by his research team, have targeted voters in Europe, “promoting fears of immigration or false claims of refugee criminality.” Eugene Rumer, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, testified that in Germany, Russia is helping the far-right “Alternative for Germany” party and fomenting anger at Chancellor Angela Merkel for accepting Muslim refugees. Get Slate in your inbox. Sen. Marco Rubio—who, according to Watts, was targeted by Russian agents online in last year’s Republican presidential primaries—illustrated the Russian technique with a story: We all know that Angela Merkel has taken a tough line on Ukraine against Russia. We know that there’s a lot of controversy in Germany around migrants. In early 2016, a 13-year-old known only as Lisa F., a dual Russian–German citizen whose family had moved to Germany from Russia in 2004, told police she had been kidnapped in East Berlin by what appeared to be Middle Eastern migrants and raped for over 30 hours. There was outrage in Germany and obviously protests against Merkel. The Russian foreign minister almost immediately jumped on the story, talking about the need to defend “our Lisa,” and of course this story was spread far and wide by Russian-speaking entities and Russian media outlets. Subsequently, the prosecutors in Berlin announced that they had clear evidence that during those 30 hours she was missing, Lisa F. was actually, in fact, with people that she knew, and a medical examination showed that she had not been the victim of rape. Advertisement Rubio gave other examples: “a false story … claiming that Germany's oldest church had been burnt down by a thousand Muslims chanting ‘Allah akbar.’ Another story claiming that the European Union was planning to ban snowmen as racist.” Again and again, these internet campaigns appealed to white European ethnic and religious anxieties. And all of the stories have been debunked. When Rubio asked the witnesses whether Putin was trying “to sow instability, pit us against each other as Americans,” Watts answered in the affirmative. Since 2014, Watts said, he and his colleagues have monitored Russian media, trolls, and bots, watching them target “nearly any disaffected U.S. audience.” In one case, for example, they spread reports of “chaos among Black Lives Matter protests.” Trump is part of the con. From 2011 to 2016, he promulgated the lie that Barack Obama’s birth certificate was fake. Russian state-operated media avidly promoted this fiction. “Part of the reason active measures have worked in this U.S. election is because the commander-in-chief has used Russian active measures,” Watts told the committee. “He’s made claims of voter fraud, that President Obama’s not a citizen, that [Sen. Ted] Cruz is not a citizen. … They parrot the same lines.” Watts told the committee that among the troll accounts monitored by his team, “The most common words found in English-speaking Twitter user profiles were God, military, Trump, family, country, conservative, Christian, America, and Constitution.” These social cues helped the trolls connect with Americans who might vote for Trump. “If you inhale all the accounts of people in Wisconsin, you identify the most common terms,” said Watts. “You just recreate accounts that look exactly like people from Wisconsin. So that way, whenever you’re trying to socially engineer them and convince them that the information is true, it’s much more simple, because you see somebody, and they look exactly like you.” Leftists can be played in similar ways. At the hearing, Rumer observed that Russia had exploited the Occupy Wall Street movement to feed class antagonism and discredit American democracy. Rubio pointed to another case, described by Adrian Chen in the New York Times Magazine, in which Russian-orchestrated accounts circulated a false rumor that “an unarmed black woman had been shot to death by police” in Atlanta. Alexander said Russia also targeted supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders in last year’s Democratic presidential primaries.

In fact, your sincerity made you a more attractive target. “Soviet-bloc disinformation specialists preferred the art of exploiting what was then called unwitting agents,” said Thomas Rid, a cyberwar expert from Kings College London, in his testimony to the committee. “There is no contradiction, in their reading, between being an honest American patriot and at the same time furthering the cause of Russia.” Today, it’s conservatives who are manipulated this way. And what Russia exploits, to turn them into devices of American and Western self-destruction, is xenophobia.

      "text" : "TOKYO — North Korea put on a huge military spectacle Saturday to celebrate its founder’s birthday, parading its series of new and technologically advanced missiles in front of Kim Jong Un, and in a defiant show of force in front of the world. North Korea did not, however, carry out another nuclear test or ballistic missile launch, against widespread speculation that it would seek to celebrate Kim Il Sung’s 105th birthday with a bang. [A timeline of North Korea’s five nuclear tests and how the U.S. has responded] April 15 is the most important day in the North Korean calendar, and Kim Jong Un has celebrated his grandfather’s birthday with great fanfare as a way to boost his own legitimacy as the successor to the communist dynasty. North Korea presented two of its newest missiles at the parade in Kim Il Sung Square on Saturday, including the submarine-launched ballistic missile it successfully fired last year and the land-based version it launched last month. Tensions mount between the U.S. and North Korea Embed Copy Share Play Video0:54 (Reuters) North Korea says the U.S. is escalating the situation on the Korean peninsula as Pyongyang prepares for a celebration on April 15. North Korea says the U.S. is escalating the situation on the Korean peninsula as Pyongyang prepares for a celebration on April 15. (Reuters) “And there were a lot of them,” said Melissa Hanham, an expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California. “The signal that they’re trying to send is that they are moving ahead with solid-fuel missiles.” North Korea has been working on solid fuel, which means missiles are ready to fire and don’t need loading with propellant like its previous liquid-fueled missiles, as a way to fire missiles quickly and without detection by satellites. Analysts were working to identify all the missiles that were shown off on Saturday, many of which appeared to have new paint jobs or be variants on known missiles. [ With both the U.S. and North Korea saber rattling, is conflict imminent? ] One of the missiles looked similar to the KN-08 intercontinental ballistic missile that North Korea had included in previous parades. This missile has a theoretical range of about 7,500 miles, which is enough to reach all of the United States from North Korea, said Joshua Pollack, editor of the Nonproliferation Review. It also put two ICBM canisters, which protect solid-fueled missiles from the effects of the environment, on the trucks that had carried the ICBMs previously. One may have been a KN-14, another missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, although it has a slightly shorter range. The trucks that carried the missile canisters were Chinese ones that has been exported to North Korea’s forestry ministry but have shown up in military parades like this one. Trump says good trade with China hinges on help with North Korea Embed Copy Share Play Video1:32 (White House) President Trump spoke highly of Chinese President Xi during a press conference at the White House on April 12, but avoided commenting directly on the decision not to label China a currency manipulator. \"We're going to see,\" he said when asked if a deal was struck. Trump spoke highly of China's president on April 12, but avoided commenting directly on his decision not to label China a currency manipulator. (White House) Saturday’s display was worrying, Hanham said. “They have an indigenous tank system now so they have more launchers, and they have solid fuel, which means they can launch a lot more of these things in quick succession without having to refuel,” she said. The overall message to the world was that North Korea was pressing ahead with its missiles and making technological progress. The parade took place amid stern warnings from the outside world, and mounting fears about some kind of military action in the region. The United States has sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the Korean Peninsula region, and President Trump has repeatedly tweeted that if China will not use its leverage to rein in North Korea, the United States will act. Vice President Pence arrives in Seoul on Sunday on the first leg of an Asia tour, and he will underscore Washington’s strong alliances with South Korea and Japan and their determination to stop North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. China on Friday urged the United States and North Korea not to push their recriminations to a point of no return and allow war to break out on the peninsula. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said “storm clouds” were gathering, an apparent reference to North Korean preparations to conduct a new nuclear test and the United States’ deployment of a naval strike force to the waters off the peninsula. In addition, the U.S. military has been conducting large-scale exercises with South Korean forces, drills that the North considers provocative. [Why is April 15 such a big deal in North Korea?] “The United States and South Korea and North Korea are engaging in tit for tat, with swords drawn and bows bent,” Wang said at a news conference. “We urge all parties to refrain from inflammatory or threatening statements or deeds to prevent irreversible damage to the situation on the Korean Peninsula.” Later Friday, Wang called his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and said it was in both countries’ interests to prevent an outbreak of war. “China welcomes close collaboration with Russia to cool down the Korean Peninsula situation as quickly as possible and encourage the involved parties to resume dialogue,” he said, according to China’s Foreign Ministry. Trump administration officials describe the situation as more dangerous than in the past, because of the progress North Korea has made in its nuclear and missile programs and because of the hostility on both sides. But U.S. officials said no decision has been made about how to respond to any new test — nuclear or ballistic — by North Korea. While officials do not rule out other actions, they also stress their desire to ensure that the situation does not escalate out of control. Pentagon officials denied recent media reports that the Trump administration is ready to launch a preemptive strike if North Korea appears to be about to conduct a nuclear test. [ As North Korea celebrates anniversary, its neighbors are united by jitters ] North Korea Friday accused President Trump of “making trouble” with his “aggressive” tweets, amid concerns that tensions between the two countries could escalate into military action. North Korea’s vice foreign minister said that Trump was “becoming more vicious and more aggressive” than previous presidents and that this was only making matters worse. “Trump is always making provocations with his aggressive words,” Han Song Ryol told the Associated Press in an interview in Pyongyang. “So that’s why. It’s not the DPRK but the U.S. and Trump that makes trouble,” he said, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as North Korea is officially known. Han also repeated the regime’s common refrain that North Korea is ready to act to defend itself. “We’ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands, and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a U.S. preemptive strike,” Han told the AP. North Korea has a habit of fueling tensions to increase the rewards it might extract from the outside world if it desists. Previously, the North has agreed to return to denuclearization talks in return for aid or the easing of sanctions. The North Korean army meanwhile threatened to annihilate U.S. military bases in South Korea and the presidential palace in Seoul in response to what it called Trump’s “maniacal military provocations.” [ Kim Jong Un’s rockets are getting an important boost — from China ] But with his approach, Trump is tearing up the old playbook of how to deal with North Korea, analysts said. “This approach to North Korea is relatively new,” said James Kim of the Asan Institute of Policy Studies in Seoul. “The approach in the past has been very calculated.” That has gone out the window with talk about military options, he said. “We always knew all these options were there, but no one was bold enough to go down that path. It’s a new approach.” Some in Beijing are noticing the shift, too. “It should be noted that there is a personality difference between Trump and Obama,” the Global Times newspaper wrote Friday. The paper does not speak for the Chinese government on policy but often reflects a strain of thinking within the Communist Party. “Trump is also willing to show he is different. Bombing Syria helps him to show that,” it continued, while noting that he was far from “revolutionary” because he dispatched only missiles, not troops. world Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-baseballs-biggest-arms-are-ditching-the-windup-1492008747This spring, Washington Nationals ace Stephen Strasburg asked a simple question that threatens to upend more than a century of baseball tradition: Why should he pitch one way with nobody on base, and another way with runners aboard? After all, he threw just as hard from the stretch as he did from the full windup, but with improved precision.Strasburg did some research and embarked on an experiment. He ditched the windup and plans to work exclusively from the stretch this season, beginning his delivery facing third base instead of home plate. Pitchers usually deploy the stretch—a quicker, more compact delivery than the full windup—with runners on base to prevent base-stealers.\n“It’s really not a crazy idea,” said Strasburg, who allowed five runs in 14 innings in his first two outings in 2017. “It’s all about repeating mechanics. What’s the difference with nobody on? Less is more.”By eliminating his windup, a technique long considered a fundamental part of a starter’s repertoire, Strasburg established himself as an early adopter in what could turn into a pitching revolution.Texas’ Yu Darvish and Cleveland’s Carlos Carrasco pitch solely from the stretch, and Strasburg cited them as inspiration for his change. Others, including Boston’s David Price, Toronto’s Marcus Stroman and the New York Mets’ Noah Syndergaard, have minimized their windups to the point that they resemble a modified version of the stretch. All three formerly pitched with a typical windup.The denizens of this growing trend view the windup as a pointless anachronism, a relic from a previous era that appears to make sense in theory but fails to hold up to scrutiny. It seems logical that the rocking, twisting ritual of the windup would help pitchers derive more power.But today, some believe the windup only creates excess movement, offering more opportunity for something to go awry. From the stretch, they simply hike their leg and go.Without the extra and unnecessary motion, they can more easily replicate their mechanics, leading to better control and rendering the windup into nothing more than an elaborate way of pitching worse.“I always had trouble finding a balance point, and I would be not under control at all,” said Syndergaard, who switched from a windup to his current delivery last season. “I like my motion now because it’s simple and easy to repeat.”Strasburg said he first considered the benefits of pitching stretch-only in college, but committed to it now after feeling increasingly uncomfortable in the windup. Nationals pitching coach Mike Maddux, who worked with Darvish during his tenure in the same role with the Rangers, said that Darvish had fastball command issues in his windup. Out of the stretch, Maddux said Darvish “repeats his delivery the best of anybody I’ve really seen.”For most of baseball history, conventional wisdom has said that the stretch reduced velocity and put more strain on the arm, resulting in injury. Thanks to modern science, the game now knows those perceptions aren’t true.In November 2007, a team of researchers including renowned surgeon Dr. James Andrews and Glenn Fleisig, the research director at the American Sports Medicine Institute, published their findings after analyzing 28 professional pitchers from the windup and the stretch. Their research concluded, “The pitching biomechanics between the windup and stretch fastball showed no statistical differences in joint kinetics or timing and clinically insignificant differences in ball velocity.”Equipped with that knowledge, some pitchers now wonder why the windup exists at all. The majority of relievers abandoned the windup years ago, arguing that they often enter games with men on base, anyway.“You’re going to see it more and more because it simplifies everything.” Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen said. “The game moves on. Pitchers are bigger. There are a lot more moving parts, so you have to simplify it.”The shift toward accepting stretch-only as a viable approach happened slowly. Decades ago, most starters employed big, multi-step windups, sometimes raising their hands over the heads, twirling around or pumping their arms before delivering toward the plate. Some elaborate windups, like the ones made famous by the likes of Juan Marichal, Luis Tiant and Hideo Nomo, have attained legendary status.Now, however, even pitchers who use the windup favor a more streamlined interpretation.Rick Peterson, a longtime pitching coach for multiple organizations, said that during his time with the Oakland Athletics, he instructed his starters to begin their deliveries facing on an angle, rather than straight toward the plate. He did this to make it easier for them to pivot on the rubber, a tricky part of the windup where pitchers can lose their balance and misfire. Led by Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito, Oakland’s rotation ranked in the top three in American League ERA every year from 2000 through 2005. Peterson sees the stretch-only group as a natural progression of what the A’s and others started back then.“People in baseball are really reticent to change,” said Peterson, who recently co-authored “Crunch Time,” a book on how to handle pressure situations. “The bottom line is that this is an easier delivery to repeat and be on time bio-mechanically.”Yet resistance remains. Syndergaard said that while in the minor leagues, he already started to realize that he felt more comfortable out of the stretch and struggled with his mechanics out of the windup. But his pitching coach would not let him change, telling Syndergaard that “a windup should be important to you. You’re king of the hill.”Both Warthen and Maddux said they would have no problem if any of their starters wanted to dump their windups. But Maddux stressed that “it has to be their choice.” Strasburg emphasized that some pitchers feel that they “need to use a windup to gain more momentum” and maintain rhythm on the mound.But the primary reason the windup is still so prevalent is simply because of tradition and routine rather than competitive advantage. That’s why that if Syndergaard ever finds himself teaching a child how to pitch, he knows exactly how he’d do it.“I would start off with pitching in the stretch,” he said. “And go from there.” Write to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com Sign Out WSJ MembershipCustomer ServiceTools & FeaturesAdsMore",

If he is anxious, it is because he knows that other men — lesser, smaller men who hate to see a man like him — are gathering to plot against him. He is rakishly handsome and universally admired. When he opens his mouth, people are impressed. When he closes it, they weep. Sometimes, just as a special favor to them, because he is broad-minded like that, he will call women on the telephone and allegedly give them a wonderful compliment: his sexual attention and a reference to a loofah. But some of these women are ungrateful, and instead of being flattered, they complained to a lawyer. And now a vile and pointless newspaper has gotten wind of it. And a conspiracy is brewing. The conspirators come from Australia. They are not great men themselves, merely the sons of a great man. Lachlan. James. The names are not even prepossessing. But like King Lear, their great father is waning in his dying years. He has grown soft, and like vultures with bad hair, they are swooping in. Just looking at them, you can definitely tell that they had not bedded as many women as John Wilkes Booth. (Editor’s Note: Citation?) (NOTE TO EDITOR: NO! THAT ISN’T HOW WE DO THINGS!) But what they hoped to do would be, in the end, far worse than what he had done. They conspired against the one beacon of spinless light still left in a chaos-ridden world. They wanted to destroy the “Factor.” While they meet, Bill sits in Italy. He is in the city of St. Peter. But someone far more noteworthy is about to be crucified. Wednesday, April 19, 2017 The man with minutes left to live is touching the pope. The air smells of forsythia, probably. We wrote this very fast because we need to come out with at least 1.5 of these books every year, but that looks like how it would have smelled. The pope will later write (NO, I DON’T HAVE A CITATION FOR THIS! AS I TOLD YOU, THIS WAS COMPOSED IN HASTE!) that this is the closest he has ever felt to touching God. Maybe it is. Bill’s confidence is not waning. Not yet. He has taken them on before, these ant-men — not ant-men in the sense that “Ant-Man” had been a fairly successful entry in the Marvel canon, but ant-men in the sense that they were weak and puny and Bill O’Reilly could kill them at any time by turning a magnifying glass on them. He has weathered all of it. He has been fighting since the day he was born: fighting to honor the memory of the nuns he saw shot in the head (Editor’s note: Citation needed) (NO, I TOLD YOU!) and fighting the fact-checkers tooth and nail. Bill O’Reilly is widely regarded as a prophet, even in his home town. He has even inspired a pathetic, small-minded man to perform in a parody of him for years on television — the highest form of flattery. That man now sits at his desk, feeling as though all the light has gone out of the world. And it has. His phone rings. The lawyer again. The news is bad. They’ve killed it. Those maniacs. The most beautiful thing in the world. The “Factor.” How could this happen? No one had ever noticed the women before, except to pay them for their silence. And why would they? Women were for bedding, a verb we like to use here as part of our house style. They were always asking for it, these women. They were a strange species of Lady Macbeth that sometimes manifested itself at Fox News and appeared onscreen until its legs and face became hideous and it had to be concealed forever. They were not to be listened to. Everyone knew that. This was the age of Trump. A week earlier, the president had called Bill O’Reilly “a good person.” If the point of Donald Trump’s election wasn’t that you could go full “Mad Men” with your workplace environment without consequences, then it had no lesson. Then everything meant nothing. Bill had been saying this kind of thing for years. These conspirators, these so-called “people,” were all backward. Stop him now? Abandon him now? How? Why? How was this less profitable for advertisers than anything else he’d ever done? Bill for years had bravely spoken the truth about all sorts of groups — the slaves who built the White House, lounging in their comfortable accommodations with their excellent meals — the women who had put on the Wrong clothes every day and walked out into the streets just Asking for It, the Islamic faith (responsible for everything wrong in the world), the immigrants (who never worked), the poor (even worse) — and his bottom line had hardly been affected. Nothing touched him. Not even the thing with the loofah (or falafel?). He had literally made things up, and no one had minded. If he thought that he could do no wrong, he could have been forgiven for thinking it. He could have been forgiven for everything. He was Bill O’Reilly. Until now. Was a tide turning? What would life be like in this brave new world where if you were consistently victim-blaming xenophobic islamophobic racist had allegedly harassed female employees for years and years and paid out millions of dollars in settlements, it could negatively affect your bottom line? Perhaps different. Perhaps not. It was not the people who did him in, after all. They had heard him for years and never minded. Bill had forgotten about the Brands. It was not principle that ruled. Not in Fox News, where these conspirators murmured. Not even in the White House. As Bill fell, clutching his large and impressive severance check, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, two nervous but well-dressed people, were in the White House trying to persuade Trump that a nuclear conflagration might seriously damage the Trump brand. (Were they?) (HUSH!) Only one man can say for sure what other people are doing, thinking, and feeling at any given time without conducting any research on the subject, and his light has been silenced forever. Because he lives in this globe, on this planet, and in this broken world there’s no such thing as a no-spin zone.

      "text" : "ISTANBUL — A slim majority of Turkish voters agreed on Sunday to grant sweeping powers to their president, in a watershed moment that the country’s opposition fears may cement a system of authoritarian rule within one of the critical power brokers of the Middle East.With nearly 99 percent of votes in a referendum counted on Sunday night, supporters of the proposal had 51.3 percent of votes cast, and opponents had 48.7 percent, the country’s electoral commission announced.The result will take days to confirm, and the main opposition party said it would demand a recount of about 37 percent of ballot boxes, containing around 2.5 million votes.But on Sunday night the result was already a political reality, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed his victory in front of a crowd of supporters in Istanbul. “We are enacting the most important governmental reform of our history,” he said.The constitutional change will allow the winner of the 2019 presidential election to assume full control of the government, ending the current parliamentary political system.The ramifications, however, are immediate. The “yes” vote in the referendum is a validation of the current leadership style of Mr. Erdogan, who has been acting as a de facto head of government since his election in 2014 despite having no constitutional right to wield such power. The office of Turkey’s president was meant to be an impartial role without full executive authority.The result tightens Mr. Erdogan’s grip on the country, which is one of the leading external actors in the Syrian civil war, a major way station along the migration routes to Europe and a crucial Middle Eastern partner of the United States and Russia.Many analysts were surprised by the close result, saying they had expected Mr. Erdogan to achieve a larger majority because he had held the referendum within an atmosphere of fear.Since a failed coup last summer, Turkey has been under a state of emergency, a situation that allowed the government to fire or suspend about 130,000 people suspected of being connected to the failed putsch, and to arrest about 45,000.The campaign itself was characterized by prolonged intimidation of opposition members, several of whom were shot at or beaten while on the stump by persons unknown.The opposition questioned the legitimacy of the referendum after the election board made a last-minute decision to increase the burden needed to prove accusations of ballot-box stuffing. At least three instances of alleged voter fraud appeared to be captured on camera.“We are receiving thousands of complaints on election fraud,” said Erdal Aksunger, the deputy head of the main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party, known as the C.H.P. “We are evaluating them one by one.”The new system will, among other changes:■ Abolish the post of prime minister and transfer executive power to the president.■ Allow the newly empowered president to issue decrees and appoint many judges and officials responsible for scrutinizing his decisions.■ Limit the president to two five-year terms, but give the option of running for a third term if Parliament truncates the second one by calling for early elections.■ Allow the president to order disciplinary inquiries into any of Turkey’s 3.5 million civil servants, according to an analysis by the head of the Turkish Bar Association.Academics and members of the opposition are concerned that the new system will threaten the separation of powers on which liberal democracies have traditionally depended.“It represents a remarkable aggrandizement of Erdogan’s personal power and quite possibly a death blow to vital checks and balances in the country,” said Professor Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy, a Washington research group. “Judicial independence was already shockingly weak before the referendum; the new system makes that worse.”Mr. Erdogan’s supporters deny that the new system will limit political and judicial oversight. If opposition parties win control of Parliament, they could override the president’s decrees with their own legislation, while also asserting greater control over judicial appointments, supporters of the new Constitution contend.The victorious “yes” camp also argues that a strong, centralized government will make Turkey better able to tackle its many challenges, including a troubled economy, the world’s largest population of Syrian refugees, two terrorism campaigns, a civil war against Kurdish insurgents and the Syrian war across Turkey’s southern border.“A new page opens in our history of democracy with this vote,” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, an Erdogan loyalist, said in a victory speech on Sunday night. “Be sure, everyone, we will use this result as best as we can — for the wealth and peace of our people.”The fearful environment in which the referendum campaign was held has led watchdogs to question its fairness. In addition to the vast purges of perceived opposition members, the authorities also often prevented “no” campaigners from holding rallies and events. And Mr. Erdogan and his supporters often implied that their opponents were allied with terrorist groups or those suspected of plotting last year’s failed coup.Analyses of television coverage showed that the “yes” campaign received disproportionately more airtime than its opponents.“It’s been a completely unfair campaign,” said Andrej Hunko, a German lawmaker assigned by the Council of Europe to observe the election.Hundreds of election observers were also barred from monitoring the vote, and thousands of Kurds displaced by fighting in southeastern Turkey may not have been able to vote because they have no address, according to the Independent Election Monitoring Network, a Turkish watchdog.Despite this, Mr. Erdogan’s victory fell far short of the 20-point majority that he and his supporters had expected. “This is a little bit bittersweet,” said Cuneyt Deniz, an Erdogan supporter celebrating in Ankara. “We were expecting above 60 percent.”The result revealed a deeply divided country, nearly half of which now feels highly embittered. “I am incredibly sad right now,” said Yesim Kara, 37, a “no” voter in Istanbul. “Dark days are ahead.”Mr. Erdogan’s victory “will enhance the stability of the government, but it will weaken social stability,” said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research group.“The new social contract that is being built in Turkey is being based on a very weak foundation,” he added.Few could agree about how Mr. Erdogan would respond, and he offered no conclusive clues in his victory speech.In one breath, he appeared to reach out to his opponents, calling the results the “victory of everyone who said yes and no.” But in the next, he promised to reinstate the death penalty — which would end any hopes that Turkey will join the European Union — and mocked his opponents’ intent to appeal the result.“Don’t beat the air,” he said. “It is too late now.”Some believe Mr. Erdogan may initially try to rebuild relations with the West, which were severely damaged during the referendum campaign as he sought to manufacture diplomatic crises to energize his base at home.After Germany and the Netherlands blocked Turkish officials from campaigning in those countries, Mr. Erdogan said both nations had shown Nazi-like behavior, drawing a rebuke from leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Mr. Unluhisarcikli said he expected a victorious Mr. Erdogan to lead “a charm offensive toward Europe and the U.S. to gain validation of the new system — and such a charm offensive might include correcting some of the democratic backsliding that we’ve seen in Turkey.”“On the other hand, if his charm offensive is not reciprocated,” Mr. Unluhisarcikli added, “then he might start initiating a Plan B, which involves tightening his grip on Turkish society.”But Professor Eissenstat said it was unlikely Mr. Erdogan would spend any time repairing relationships with the opposition.“Some people have imagined that Erdogan might reboot after a ‘yes’ victory and reach out to the opposition,” he said. “I don’t think that is likely. The purges will continue; Erdogan’s instinct is to crush opposition, not co-opt it.“The question is whether further centralization of power and increased repression can bring stability and allow Erdogan to reboot a troubled economy,” added Professor Eissenstat, a lecturer at St. Lawrence University. “The record of the past 10 years is that the opposite is true.”Mr. Yildirim, the prime minister, suggested in his speech that the government was unlikely to step back from its various vendettas at home and abroad. “Our struggle with internal and external enemies will be intensified,” he said.",

      "text" : "White House Democrats want to know who goes to President Trump's private clubs, but no one's keeping track. By Darren Samuelsohn03/28/17 05:05 AM EDT Florida Gov. Rick Scott greats guests during a VIP reception at the annual Republican Party of Palm Beach County's Lincoln Day Dinner on March 24 at Mar-a-Lago Club. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICOPALM BEACH, Fla. — Democrats just came up with a catchy-sounding bill to force President Donald Trump to cough up a list of visitors to his private clubs.But there’s just one problem: There are no lists yet.Story Continued BelowOn Friday night, guests streamed into Mar-a-Lago, the president’s self-proclaimed “southern White House,” for the annual Palm Beach GOP Lincoln Day Dinner. All they had to do to get into the seaside retreat, where the first lady and the president’s youngest son were vacationing for spring break, was buy a $300 ticket.They didn’t have to submit to the kinds of rigorous background checks required if they’d been entering the White House in Washington. And there were no weapon screenings or bomb-sniffing dogs checking vehicles of the sort that have long been routine at public restaurants or other places where the president or first lady is present.Mar-a-Lago also doesn’t keep tabs on the identity of guests who come and go on a routine basis, even while the president is in residence. Club members call the front desk to give the names of their guests, including for parties held in the ballroom. But they don’t have to submit details, like a middle initial or birth date or Social Security number, that are standard for visitor logs or background checks — which neither the club nor the Secret Service do at the resort.Whether they realize it or not, what the Democratic lawmakers are asking for is a whole new system to be established putting Mar-a-Lago and the other Trump clubs a step closer to being on par with the White House when it comes to disclosure. White House By Darren SamuelsohnFormer U.S. Secret Service officials tell POLITICO that the agency isn't equipped — with the time or money — to do the kind of legwork that would be required to produce logs for the president’s clubs. Agents don’t do it when the president goes to a hotel or other events away from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. And they don’t see the benefit in chasing down the names of every person that a member or party host brings in and who they vouch for as a legitimate guest. “You can posture all day long, but the service can’t produce something that doesn’t exist,” said Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent. The premise behind the Democrats’ bill, he added, isn't “realistic.”“It’s a misapplication of resources,” he said.White House officials referred questions about security involving the first lady at Mar-a-Lago, as well as the collection of visitor logs at the South Florida club, to the Secret Service, which through a spokesman cited its policy of not publicly commenting “on our protective operations.” The Trump Organization, which has a large security presence at Mar-a-Lago, also did not respond to requests for comment. Security personnel escort first lady Melania Trump from a VIP reception at the annual Republican Party of Palm Beach County's Lincoln Day Dinner on March 24 at Mar-a-Lago Club. | M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICONew Mexico Democratic Sen. Tom Udall took the lead Friday introducing legislation calling on the president to begin collecting information for the public release of visitor logs for both the White House and his private properties, including Trump Tower in New York and Mar-a-Lago.“If the Secret Service can’t keep track of who has access to the president outside the White House then that’s a national security concern,” Udall said in a statement to POLITICO.“And if it's prohibitively expensive to keep track of who has access to the president when he's conducting official business, then the president should consider the taxpayers and take seriously his own promises to save the taxpayers money,” he added. “The taxpayers already generously provide a very nice home office for the president, as well as security. Should they have to pay millions of dollars more for security so the president can work in luxury clubs and golf courses that his business owns?\"The White House didn’t respond to requests for comment on the Udall bill, which the lawmaker dubbed the “Making Access Records Available to Lead American Government Openness Act,” or “Mar-a-Lago Act.”Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.Security at Mar-a-Lago remains a mixed bag. Experts have warned that the president’s repeated visits to his South Florida home — another trip is expected early next month with Chinese President Xi Jinping — exposes him and his staff to foreign intelligence agents who now have opportune targets for eavesdropping and building files on their routines and habits.When Trump is on the premises, club members and their guests must pass through multiple Secret Service checkpoints, including a vehicle inspection and a magnetometer screening for detecting weapons. But those protections are far less intrusive when the president isn’t in town, even if his family is. The guests who got a chance to briefly mingle and snap photos of the first lady Friday night at Mar-a-Lago during the Lincoln Dinner VIP cocktail reception, for example, weren’t screened for weapons.The first lady’s security detail changes depending on the particulars of any given situation, Wackrow explained. Although the Secret Service often used metal detectors at restaurants when former first lady Michelle Obama was dining out in public, the agency doesn't always default to that approach, especially if there’s no specific threat against the low-profile first lady in attendance at a semi-private club owned by the president.“Every asset in the kitchen sink goes to the president, and it steps down from there based on the threat profile,” he said. By Matthew NussbaumThere has been one notable security change at Mar-a-Lago since POLITICO revealed earlier this month that the club’s website was accessible to the public with the names, work emails and phone numbers of key staff members, including its top manager and the directors in charge of security and housekeeping. Now, that page is no longer available online.The president’s repeated visits to Mar-a-Lago have been an increasing sore spot from a security standpoint. In February, during a dinner with the Japanese prime minister, Trump and his top aides were photographed going over their response to a North Korean missile test. The military officer who carries the country’s nuclear weapon codes also posed for photos with at least one Mar-a-Lago guest, and the images made it onto social media. While first lady Melania Trump was on the property, a Secret Service agent walks the grounds ahead of the annual Republican Party of Palm Beach County's Lincoln Day Dinner on March 24 at Mar-a-Lago Club. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICOThe White House insisted in the aftermath of that dinner that no classified information was discussed in public that night. “Proper security protocols are adhered to at all times at Mar-a-Lago,” Marc Short, Trump’s legislative affairs director, added in a one-paragraph letter sent earlier this month to House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).But lawmakers still haven’t gotten all their questions answered. Chaffetz is still awaiting a classified briefing that Short promised to go over security protocols at Mar-a-Lago. And Democrats are looking toward a Government Accountability Office report that’s just getting started on the topic.Former Secret Service agents say the bureau’s primary role at Mar-a-Lago and the other Trump properties is to focus on assessing and protecting the president from physical threats. Unlike Camp David, the rural Maryland retreat that Trump has yet to visit, they note that the president’s clubs themselves are not government-controlled facilities.“It’s a significant issue, because we still have a new fledgling administration trying to get their arms around what their role is running this country, and there’s lots of little things they’ve never thought about in their entire life,” said Bill Pickle, a former deputy assistant director of the Secret Service. “The deeper and longer they get into it, the better they’ll get.” © 2017 POLITICO LLC",

Photo by Thinkstock. requirejs([\"jquery\"], function($) ); Advertisement Q. “Friend” giving me the creeps: When I first started college last year, I became close friends with a guy who also lives in my building. I would often go to his room to chat. He doesn’t quite have the ability to read when someone is not interested in a conversation topic, so he has many acquaintances but not close friends. This semester, I got a lot busier—started seeing my boyfriend and joined two clubs, so I have way less time to go over to his room and talk for extended periods of time, and have told him this. He started getting a little clingy, often asking where I was or calling me when I was on dates with my boyfriend, all of which I dealt with patiently. However, the straws that broke the camel’s back happened in one weekend—the first was when he called me incessantly while I was on a date and told all my friends that I simply don’t have time for him anymore. Then one afternoon, he texted me, saying that he was being rushed to the hospital and that he needed me, so I dropped everything and missed classes to go over, only to find out that he’d made a mountain out of a molehill. He was paranoid about contracting an illness he had already been vaccinated for; had only a single, extremely minor symptom (not even a fever or a headache); and the doctors said he was not sick at all. In the waiting room at the hospital, he started saying creepy things like “at least we can spend time together now” and the like, which made my skin crawl, and I left quickly. I don’t want to straight-up rebuke him, but at the same time, I dread seeing him around and feel like I’m being watched/monitored every time he seeks me out. How should I go about dealing with him? Subscribe to Prudie! A: I’m afraid there is nothing for you to do but to straight-up rebuke him. He faked a serious illness, wasted the hospital’s time and resources, and got you to skip classes just to force you to come see him, and that’s incredibly disturbing, not to mention a friendship-ending breach of trust. I’m concerned for your safety—this “friend” has displayed behavior that suggests he may try to stalk or otherwise manipulate you again in the future. Tell him unequivocally that his lie was unacceptable and that you’re not going to be able to see him again; do this in writing, either via text or email, so that you have a written record of your dealings with him. Tell your boyfriend and other friends what’s going on so that they know not to provide him with information about you or your whereabouts in case he tries to use them to get to you. If necessary, inform your RA and campus security in case he does not respect your request to not contact you again. They should be informed if he tries to escalate or follow you around. Pay attention to your feelings of dread and suspicion. Your sense that he is not a safe or a trustworthy person is an accurate one, and you should trust your instincts. I know you feel sympathy for his difficulty with forming lasting relationships, but there’s nothing you can do to help him now other than keep yourself safe. If he wants to seek help, you can point him in the direction of your campus’ mental health services, but it’s not your responsibility to resume a friendship with someone you know you can’t trust. Advertisement Q. Full disclosure?: I recently started dating a guy who stutters pretty severely. We’re getting to the stage where we’ll be meeting each other’s friends and family, and I’m wondering if I should “warn” them ahead of time, so they don’t react badly and will understand if he is quiet. If I do, should I let him know I told them? Is there a way to do that without making him feel like I think it’s a really big deal? A: It would be helpful for both your boyfriend and your friends to offer them a brief heads-up. Just say, “I’m really excited for you to meet my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know he has a stutter, so don’t be surprised if he’s sometimes quiet during conversation. There’s no need to prompt him or help him finish his sentences; just let him talk at his own pace.” You can also ask your boyfriend what he would prefer. He’s presumably dealt with plenty of responses to his stutter his whole life and will be able to let you know what works for him and what doesn’t. Don’t disclose this to your friends as if you are giving them bad news. Keep your tone conversational; you’re providing them with information that will make getting to know him easier, and if you make it clear that this isn’t a big deal to you, your friends are likely to follow your lead. Q. Caught cheating at a game of cards: I was playing a card game with a bunch of friends recently, and I was eliminated early and so started observing the hand and play of one of the friends sitting next to me—which was known to him (via my clear body language). During continued play, another player requested to pick a card from this friend’s hand (allowed by the rules) in an attempt to get a really valuable card. The expectation is that it is a blind pick (by rule) with the informal expectation (of card games everywhere though not explicitly written into the rules) that one would make available for picking, by fanning them out for display by your opponent, every card in your hand. The friend I was observing however arrayed his cards in the customary fashion with an exception: The most valuable card in his hand was held below the level of the arrayed “fan” so it was not visible for selection by his opponent. I was, frankly, appalled and shocked by this behavior as, though its “only a game,” my expectation is everyone still plays it “fairly,” by which I mean they don’t subvert the intent of the rules to give themselves an unfair advantage. Question is, what, if anything, should I do about it? Have a frank conversation with him about it privately? Avoid ever picking from his hand in a similar situation (thereby letting him benefit from the unfair advantage I know he sometimes takes)? Avoid ever playing that, or games with similar rules with him again? I know it may seem silly that this bothers me, but it does. A: In a situation like this one, I think it’s best to say something in the moment. “Hang on, there’s a card that’s not showing; you need to fan your cards out further so they’re all visible.” You can keep your tone light and let your friend save face by allowing for the possibility that it was an honest mistake, but you don’t have to wait to pull him aside. Now that the moment’s passed, it may not be worth bringing up (especially since it will be fairly easy for him to “not remember” what you’re talking about), but by all means, if you see him holding something back in future games, speak up. Or, if you decide you’d rather not play with him at all, that’s fine too. Cheating in card games is only fun if everyone agrees to do it or if nobody does it; everything in between is tiresome.

Dating co-workers: Years ago, I ended up in a mess due to dating a co-worker. I swore it never was going to happen again. Fast-forward to now, I left a dying career to work in fast food. Our maintenance guy is about my age and apparently has voiced his interest in dating me (though not to me), but I simply responded to it with the truth about why I wouldn’t be interested in dating him. However, I’m now likely moving to night shift. Therefore, I would never work with him, and based on his reaction to finding this out, I think he may ask me out. Part of me wants to give it a go (I like the guy enough), but we still technically are co-workers, and of course now we’ll also be on opposing schedules. What’s the best way to respond to this? A: You have a policy about never dating co-workers, and now you have a co-worker who has not actually asked you out. I think you should continue to not date this guy. You say only “part” of you wants to give this a go and that you like him “enough.” That doesn’t seem like sufficient reason to break your policy, given how badly things have gone for you in the past. There are a lot of other people to date who don’t work in your building. Advertisement Q. Re: “Friend” giving me the creeps: You NEED to straight-up tell him/rebuke him. He will take any “nice” way of telling him or subtle backing off as a sign that you do really want to be with him. Then you need to not respond to any contact. Q. Typical troll living in Mom’s basement?: Two-plus years ago I lost my well-paying job. Shortly thereafter I had a grand mal seizure, which has left me partially disabled. After exhausting all my retirement funds (yes, I did save), I was foreclosed on. I had to walk away from the home I owned for over a decade as well as even pictures on the walls. My mother offered me a place to stay with her in an impoverished state in a rural area. My parents are both elderly, and even with somewhat limited mobility, I could help out. Problem is, now that I’m here—it is very unseemly for a man in his mid-40s to be living with his mom. I live in an addition with my own entrance, pay rent, and help to pet-sit, etc. for them for hospital stays. The job hunt to get me back to where I was is going nowhere. Should I just suck my pride up or feel like the kid that never left the nest even though I have been independent and successful? The jobs here pay nothing, so moving out anytime soon is unrealistic. A: If nothing else, I hope you can see that you should be proud of yourself, not “sucking up your pride.” Living as a financially independent adult is a great goal, but it’s not the end-all and be-all of human development. It’s a goal, not the goal. And living with your mother because you’ve suffered grand mal seizures and had to drain your retirement account just to make ends meet is not a sign of failure, nor is it in any way a compromise of the independence and success you’ve found in adulthood. You’re going through an incredibly difficult time right now, and it doesn’t look like things are going to get better overnight. In the meantime you’re doing everything you can to contribute to the workings of your mother’s household, both financially and in terms of everyday housework. I encourage you to think of yourself as an incredibly resilient and resourceful person who is fortunate enough to have family members who are willing and able to help him out during a tough time. That’s the person who comes through in this letter. Take care of your health, recognize the wisdom of the choices you have already made, and don’t rush yourself to get out of the house before it’s financially viable. Q. Breaking the news: I have been involved with a married man for several years now. His wife has been his “roommate” the whole time: different bedrooms, no interest in the marriage, but unwilling to end the marriage. She told him to find someone else for sex, and he did—me. The two of us were friends for a long time before this phase of our relationship. He’s finally getting a divorce and has asked me to move in with him when the lease is up on my apartment. By that time, he’ll be divorced. But here’s the thing—because he was married, no one knows we were seeing each other. So how do we announce this bombshell? We have a group of friends we see weekly, but no one knows. Our families don’t know. So do we just play this off as we became roommates and then more? Or do we confess that we truly love each other and want to spend our lives together from the get-go? Advertisement A: Oh my God, I am so relieved that someone is writing to me before they start weaving a web of complicated lies that have recently started coming apart. This was the right time to contact an advice columnist! Don’t pretend to fall in love from scratch for the benefit of your friends and family. It will become an exhausting and weird pantomime, and if either of you ever slips up, you’re going to have seriously damaged your relationships with some of the most important people in your life. Just tell your friends and family that you have someone in your life you’d like them to meet, that he’s been separated for a number of years and recently finalized his divorce. You don’t have to go into details about his arrangement with his first wife as long as you make it clear they had separated long before he met you. Announcing that you’re moving in with someone your friends didn’t realize you were seeing is shocking, but it’s low-level shocking. If they ever found out that you’d actually been with your boyfriend for three years when you’d been pretending to only have known him for three months, that would be mid-level shocking, and you’d find yourself having to produce far more justifications and explanations than you do now. Q. Blind neighbor: I live in an apartment building in a large metropolitan area. My very friendly neighbor (let’s call her “Chelizabeth”) is blind. We met when she knocked on my door one day for help using an app, and occasionally when I see her in the building, we stop and chat about graduate school and life in general. Generally, I stop her, since she usually doesn’t know when we cross paths unless I stop and identify myself. My question is, what is the etiquette when I see her on the street (and in the building for that matter)? When I run into my other neighbors, I usually give a wave or a nod. With Chelizabeth, I sometimes feel that I’m imposing, since it takes a moment to stop and tell her who I am. It especially feels awkward when she’s with a friend or classmate. Also, to be perfectly honest, it’s sometimes just easier to keep moving on without saying anything. I don’t know if that’s rude, though. Or is it rude to stop and say hello? If it helps, this is not a building (or city) where people typically get to know their neighbors. Top Comment The fix for the card cheat, is to continue to play with him, wait for your turn to choose from his hand, then feel under the fan for the hidden card, and pull it out. More... Join In A: A good rule of thumb for a casual social interaction with a neighbor is: Would this make both of our respective days slightly pleasanter or slightly more inconvenient? If you think you’d be imposing, or if she’s clearly mid-sentence with someone and you’d have to interrupt to announce your presence, then by all means, don’t force yourself into her conversation. But if she’s not otherwise occupied, and you’re merely a little self-conscious about having to identify yourself, go ahead and take that extra moment to say, “Hi, Chelizabeth! It’s Margareth the Unbloodied, and it’s great to see you; I hope you’re having a good day.” Mallory Ortberg: Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel. Mirab, with sails unfurled. See you all next week.

Here are the key turning points in their fight to pass the bill. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Republicans withdrew the American Health Care Act moments before a scheduled vote on March 24, after failing to woo enough lawmakers to support it. Here are the key turning points in their fight to pass the bill. Here are the key turning points in the Republicans' fight to pass the American Health Care Act. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Why were Republicans rushing to vote on a health-care plan that they'd barely finished drafting, that budget scorekeepers hadn't had a chance to fully evaluate, and that, insofar as people did know about it, was widely despised? In part, it's because their plan was so unpopular and because it got more unpopular the more people learned about it. But it's also because only by rushing to reshape a full sixth of the American economy without knowing exactly how they would be reshaping it would Republicans be able to use health care to pave the way for the rest of their agenda, including tax reform. In other words, the GOP didn't want to let a detail like tens of millions of people losing their health insurance get in the way of two tax cuts for the rich. Here's what we knew about the Republican plan. The latest version that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had a chance to analyze would have, over the course of 10 years, cut taxes by $1 trillion, disproportionately benefiting the rich; cut Medicaid spending by $839 billion, exclusively harming the poor and sick; and cut the Affordable Care Act's health insurance subsidies by about $300 billion, mostly hurting older people of modest means. Add it all up, and the CBO estimated that 24 million people would have lost their health insurance as a result. Not only that, but premiums would have increased 15 percent to 20 percent more than they otherwise would have in the next four years before so many older people were priced out of the market that premiums would have started to come down, and deductibles, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, would have been an average of $1,550 higher. In short: The GOP would have made insurance more affordable for younger people by making it unaffordable for older people and worse for everyone. This wasn't just a matter of higher premiums and higher deductibles, though. Trumpcare also would have repealed the “essential health benefits” that plans are required to cover now. States would have been allowed to write their own rules, so, depending on where you lived, insurance companies might have been able to sell you “insurance” that didn't cover hospitalizations, prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health care and preventive care, and also imposed annual and lifetime limits on your benefits. People who couldn't afford insurance that actually, you know, insured them might have bought these skimpy plans with their skimpy tax credits — why not use them on a fake something instead of a real nothing? — but neither the CBO nor they themselves likely would have thought of this as being covered. The surprising thing, then, isn't that as few as 17 percent of people approved of the American Health Care Act. It's that as many as 17 percent did. But there's a reason the GOP was pushing a bill that would have taken everything people don't like about the health-care system and made it worse. That's the fact that it would have allowed them to pass two permanent tax cuts for the rich. Anyone, you see, can pass a tax cut that expires after 10 years. But if you want to make it last — and you don't have 60 votes in the Senate — then you need to find a way to pay for it (or at least look like you did). Taking health insurance away from poor and sick people would have done just that for the Obamacare taxes, which primarily hit people in the top 1 or 2 percent. Indeed, as you can see below in the chart from the Urban Institute, the combination of tax cuts for the rich and benefit cuts for the poor that was the GOP health-care plan would have been a reverse Robin Hood that redistributed income from people making $50,000 or less to mostly those making $200,000 or more. business wonkblog true Wonkbook newsletter Your daily policy cheat sheet from Wonkblog. Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Now, the crazy thing is that this first tax cut for the rich (in the form of Obamacare “repeal and replace”) would have made a second one (this one coming in the form of “tax reform”) look more affordable. That's because, due to parliamentary rules, tax revisions can't lose any revenue outside the 10-year budget window if it's going to be permanent. The question, though, is lose revenue compared to what. If Republicans had repealed the Affordable Care Act's $1 trillion worth of taxes before they revised taxes, that's $1 trillion less they'd have to come up with to make it look like money wasn't being lost. Now, without those phantom savings, tax restructuring, Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) admitted, will be “more difficult.” Not that it was ever going to be easy. After all, the $1 trillion they were trying to save with a “border adjustment tax” seems to be on political life support, since every major retailer, including big GOP donors such as Walmart, is opposed to it. And, as you might have guessed, there aren't an extra $2 trillion of savings lying around for them to replace the ones they thought they were going to get from this and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Which is to say that Republicans will either have to scale back their ambitions for how deeply they will cut taxes or how long they will. Whatever they choose, though, the top tax rate isn't going to stay under 30 percent. And for the GOP, that's the real tragedy of 24 million people keeping their health insurance.",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — For the first 10 weeks of President Trump’s administration, no adviser loomed larger in the public imagination than Stephen K. Bannon, the raw and rumpled former chairman of Breitbart News who considers himself a “virulently anti-establishment” revolutionary out to destroy the “administrative state.”But behind the scenes, White House officials said, the ideologist who enjoyed the president’s confidence became increasingly embattled as other advisers, including Mr. Trump’s daughter and son-in-law, complained about setbacks on health care and immigration. Lately, Mr. Bannon has been conspicuously absent from some meetings. And now he has lost his seat at the national security table.In a move that was widely seen as a sign of changing fortunes, Mr. Trump removed Mr. Bannon, his chief strategist, from the National Security Council’s cabinet-level “principals committee” on Wednesday. The shift was orchestrated by Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, who insisted on purging a political adviser from the Situation Room where decisions about war and peace are made.Mr. Bannon resisted the move, even threatening at one point to quit if it went forward, according to a White House official who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Mr. Bannon’s camp denied that he had threatened to resign and spent the day spreading the word that the shift was a natural evolution, not a signal of any diminution of his outsize influence.His allies said privately that Mr. Bannon had been put on the principals committee to keep an eye on Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, a retired three-star general who lasted just 24 days before being forced out for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about what he had discussed with Russia’s ambassador. With Mr. Flynn gone, these allies said, there was no need for Mr. Bannon to remain, but they noted that he had kept his security clearance.“Susan Rice operationalized the N.S.C. during the last administration,” Mr. Bannon said in a statement, referring to President Barack Obama’s national security adviser. “I was put on the N.S.C. with General Flynn to ensure that it was de-operationalized. General McMaster has returned the N.S.C. to its proper function.”Mr. Bannon did not explain what he meant by “operationalized” or how his presence on the committee had ensured it would not be.It was one more drama in a White House consumed by palace intrigue, where officials jockey for the ear of the president, angle for authority and seek to place blame for political defeats. Even as Mr. Bannon lost a national security credential, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, seems to be acting as a shadow secretary of state, visiting Iraq and taking on China, Mexico and Middle East portfolios.Mr. Bannon’s many enemies, inside and outside the White House, celebrated what they saw as a defeat for his brand of fiery, nationalist politics.“He didn’t belong on the principals committee to begin with — doesn’t really belong in the White House at all,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. “I hope that this is a sign that McMaster is taking control of the National Security Council.”Karl Rove — who, as senior adviser to President George W. Bush, was not allowed to join national security meetings — said it was a move back to a better process. “It was wrong for him to be added in the first place, and it was right to take him off,” he said.Even if Mr. Bannon really was removed only because there was no longer a need for someone to mind Mr. Flynn, Mr. Rove added, the end result was a victory for General McMaster. “It’s either a sign of McMaster’s strength, or the result is it strengthens McMaster,” he said.Still, Mr. Bannon, who has been under attack from outside the administration since the early days of the transition, is a crafty survivor, and insiders warned that it would be a mistake to underestimate him. When General McMaster wanted to fire a staff member, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, Mr. Bannon intervened to save his job.Mr. Cohen-Watnick had alerted colleagues that Mr. Trump’s associates had been caught up in surveillance of foreigners, information then shown by another White House official to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in last year’s election.James Jeffrey, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Bush, said General McMaster appeared to have “scored one on the presumably more powerful Bannon,” but cautioned against reading too much into what it meant for Mr. Bannon. “He seems to be very close to the president and, by most accounts, still wins many of his battles,” Mr. Jeffrey said.From the start, General McMaster intended to revamp the National Security Council organization that he inherited from Mr. Flynn. The principals committee, which is led by the national security adviser and includes the vice president, secretary of state, defense secretary and others, is the primary policy-making body deciding questions that do not rise to the level of the president and framing those that do.The initial structure approved by Mr. Trump not only gave Mr. Bannon formal membership on the committee, but also downgraded the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence to occasional participants as issues demanded.In addition to removing Mr. Bannon, the new order issued by Mr. Trump, dated Tuesday and made public on Wednesday, restored the Joint Chiefs chairman and intelligence director and added the energy secretary, C.I.A. director and United Nations ambassador. It also put the Homeland Security Council under General McMaster rather than making it a separate entity, as Mr. Trump’s original order had done.Mr. Trump was angry over the fallout from his first order, feeling that he had not been properly warned about its implications. He briefly considered reversing it the same weekend it was announced, according to a person with direct knowledge, but decided against it for fear of creating more of a public storm.For the first two months of Mr. Trump’s presidency, Mr. Bannon occupied an unassailable perch at the president’s side — ramming through key elements of his eclectic and hard-edge populist agenda, including two executive orders on freezing immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. Mr. Trump viewed Mr. Bannon as a street-fighting kindred spirit who favored his own attack-when-attacked communications strategy.But blunders by Mr. Bannon’s team — especially the first immigration order, which was rejected by multiple courts — have undermined his position. His take-no-prisoners style was not a winning strategy on Capitol Hill, and Mr. Bannon declined to take a significant part. Experienced politicians, including Mr. Pence and Mr. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, stepped into more expansive roles as negotiations over the failed health care overhaul dragged on.Mr. Trump initially supported Mr. Bannon’s take-it-or-leave-it final message to holdouts in the House Freedom Caucus. But, needing a win, the president grew skeptical and authorized Mr. Pence to resume health care talks, with Mr. Bannon playing more of a supporting role, according to three people close to Mr. Trump.Mr. Bannon has also been at odds with Gary Cohn, the president’s national economics adviser. Mr. Cohn is close with Mr. Kushner, who has said privately that he fears that Mr. Bannon plays to the president’s worst impulses, according to people with direct knowledge of such discussions.Moreover, Mr. Bannon’s Svengali-style reputation has chafed on a president who sees himself as the West Wing’s only leading man. Several associates said the president had quietly expressed annoyance over the credit Mr. Bannon had received for setting the agenda — and Mr. Trump was not pleased by the “President Bannon” puppet-master theme promoted by magazines, late-night talk shows and Twitter.Yet there is a risk for Mr. Trump in appearing to minimize Mr. Bannon, a hero to the nationalist, anti-immigration base that helped drive Mr. Trump to an Electoral College victory. With his approval ratings at historic lows for so early in a presidency, he is counting on the same people who see Mr. Bannon as their champion — just as Mr. Bannon is counting on Mr. Trump to retain his place in the White House inner circle.",

      "text" : "We’re 11 weeks into the Trump administration. What’s the Senate like these days? I think that the institution — and I do mean all 535 people, but particularly the hundred in the Senate — is filled with really nice and well-meaning people. I’ve been there 27 months.But who’s counting? My average duration in a job is more like six months, because I’ve done crisis and turnaround stuff for two decades. I’ve been in a lot of companies and not-for-profits and institutions that were really on fire; in a lot of ways, the Senate is the least urgent, least serious institution I’ve ever worked in. There’s this constant fighting. You should agree on what you’re arguing about before you argue: We are either going to work at our house tonight or we’re going to make dinner together and play music in the living room or we’re going to go out to eat and go to a movie.But the problem is that, at this particular juncture, there’s also a question of whether this hypothetical movie theater even exists. Why are you playing to this outdated, modernist idea that there are objective facts? [Laughs.] What is wrong with you?We do have to agree on some basic facts, despite this general reluctance to grant them legitimacy. Yeah, it’s a huge problem. I sit in the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s seat on the Senate floor. He’s the author of the saying, Everyone’s entitled to their own opinion, but you’re not entitled to your own facts. Look at trade and automation: two competing but slightly overlapping forces in the shrinking of the duration of jobs right now. We have to be able to talk honestly about how disrupted this world is going to be, and it is crazy to mislead people and say we’re going to bring back all of the big factory jobs by creating a protectionist regime. That isn’t true.Do you think that infighting creates a situation in which everyday Americans write off all politicians as cheaters and liars? It might explain how Donald Trump won, because it didn’t make any difference to anybody that he seemed immoral — they thought of him as no worse than every other politician. I would argue pretty vociferously that it’s also because of who his opponent was. If Joe Biden would have run against Donald Trump, Biden would have won in a landslide.You have been a constant critic of Trump, even during the primaries. I campaigned with pretty much anybody not named Trump or Huckabee.Including Ted Cruz. Your book, which argues that America’s youths are largely coddled and ill equipped to compete in the global economy, is full of references to ancient history and philosophy. Are you trying to unseat Cruz as the intellectual of the Senate? I don’t see what I’m trying to do as trying to be the intellectual in the Senate.What is it that you’re trying to do? I’m the third or fourth most conservative guy by voting record in the institution, and yet most of the stuff I care about is not really partisan. We have had no foreign policy for the past 28 years for dealing with a post-Cold War world. And now you layer on nonstate actors, like jihadis, who have a presence in a quarter to a third of all the countries in the world, and the governments in those countries aren’t the main source of power anymore. But that isn’t anywhere near what keeps the spies and generals up at night, about how cyberattacks will transform war and create all these gray areas that aren’t quite war but are warlike. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine what the obvious Republican-versus-Democratic answer looks like, with the divide between the two parties in trying to figure out a national-security strategy in this new age.",

      "text" : "Under terms set forth by Mick Mulvaney, President Trump’s budget chief, the ruination of Obamacare is once again tied up with keeping the government running.CreditPHOTOGRAPH BY JONATHAN ERNST / REUTERS Next Saturday, April 29th, is President Trump’s hundredth day in office, a historical marker used by the press to assess a new President’s progress since the first term of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. F.D.R. was grappling with the Great Depression, and he had a pliant Congress that would have passed almost anything he proposed. Presidents since then have often struggled to meet the expectations of the hundred-day report card but generally can point to a list of major legislative accomplishments. Trump does not have such a list. At the same time, the Trump White House is facing a much more consequential deadline, one that will help define his first months in office and perhaps his first term: absent a spending deal with Democrats and Republicans in Congress, next Saturday the government will shut down. While the potential for a government shutdown has been overshadowed by other events—Syria, North Korea, the attempted repeal of Obamacare—the Trump White House is suddenly seized with the issue. “Next week is going to have quite high drama,” a top White House official, who sounded excited by the coming clash, told me. “It’s going to be action-packed. This one is not getting as much attention, but, trust me, it’s going to be the battle of the titans. And the great irony here is that the call for the government shutdown will come on—guess what?—the hundredth day. If you pitched this in a studio, they would say, ‘Get out of here, it’s too ridiculous.’ This is going to be a big one.” The last government shutdown was in October, 2013, and was widely blamed on conservative Republicans in the House, with a major assist from Senator Ted Cruz, who demanded that Obamacare had to be defunded, a ludicrous strategy given that Barack Obama was President. Congress failed to pass the necessary legislation, and the government closed for two weeks before Republicans came back to the table. At the time, many predicted that the tactic would have dire political consequences for the G.O.P., but the following year the Party expanded its majority in the House and took over the Senate. Republican leaders have prevented their right wing from forcing shutdowns in the years since, but one lesson from 2013 is that the threat of a government shutdown is a powerful way to press for concessions without paying too high a political price. In recent weeks, the prospect of a government shutdown seemed low. In the House and Senate, Democratic and Republican appropriators, who, despite ideological differences, are often united in their desire to spend money, were making steady progress. But there was an elephant in the room. In mid-March, the Trump Administration released a detailed spending request that included a large increase for the military and for immigration enforcement and massive cuts to domestic discretionary spending. While the budget was released with fanfare, the White House seemed to retreat from the talks, leaving congressional Democrats and Republicans to continue their work without much guidance from Trump. Yesterday, that changed. Mick Mulvaney, a Republican and former congressman who was one of the House members who agitated for the 2013 shutdown and is now Trump’s budget director, announced that “elections have consequences.” The consequence, it would seem, was a divisive proposal. Mulvaney suggested that if Trump didn’t get his defense spending and border wall—which, it should be noted, he promised would be paid for by Mexico—then the federal payments, known as cost-sharing reduction subsidies, or C.S.R., that pay for health insurance for millions of Americans under Obamacare had to be cut from the spending bill. The ruination of Obamacare is once again tied up with keeping the government running. The funding legislation likely can’t pass in the House without some Democratic votes, and it certainly can’t pass without Democratic votes in the Senate, where Republicans need eight Democrats to reach the sixty-vote threshold to prevent a filibuster. The two sides aren’t even close. “There’s a big spread between the bid and the ask here,” the White House official said, noting that Trump wanted thirty billion dollars for defense, several billion for more ICE agents and the border wall, as well as eighteen billion dollars in cuts to domestic spending and the ability to withhold federal money from cities that don’t coöperate with immigration officials. The big priorities for Democrats are the money for those people who need Obamacare subsidies, the protection of domestic spending, and increases for programs for opioid addiction and health care for coal miners, the last two being issues that Trump ostensibly campaigned on. These shouldn’t be a big deal, Democrats say, and they have accused the White House of throwing a grenade into negotiations in order to wrest some sort of political victory in the first hundred days. “For weeks, the House and Senate Democrats and Republicans have been working well together,” a Democratic aide said. “Then, all of a sudden, the White House is looking at next week and they have nothing to show for the first one hundred days, and they either want a health-care bill to pass next week, which seems like a heavy lift, or to get more on immigration from this process. Even Republicans don’t want this fight, and they don’t want a shutdown on Day One Hundred of the Trump Administration.” The White House, which is trying to force another vote on an Obamacare repeal, seems desperate to either win some of Trump’s priorities in a deal next week, or force a government shutdown that it can blame on Democrats. That might energize Trump’s supporters, who don’t have much to celebrate yet. But it’s not just the Democrats who oppose several Trump priorities. Congressional Republicans, who are generally united in support for the increase in defense spending, are divided on the border wall, which is not popular among border-state Republicans, and the deep domestic-spending cuts. So far, it does not look like a bridgeable gap. “This is going to be high-stakes poker,” the White House official said. When I asked if a shutdown was likely, the official paused for several seconds. “I don’t know,” the official said. The official added, “I just want my wall and my ICE agents.”",

      "text" : "The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladi­mir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump, according to U.S., European and Arab officials. The meeting took place around Jan. 11 — nine days before Trump’s inauguration — in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean, officials said. Though the full agenda remains unclear, the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to Moscow on U.S. sanctions. Though Prince had no formal role with the Trump campaign or transition team, he presented himself as an unofficial envoy for Trump to high-ranking Emiratis involved in setting up his meeting with the Putin confidant, according to the officials, who did not identify the Russian. Prince was an avid supporter of Trump. After the Republican convention, he contributed $250,000 to Trump’s campaign, the national party and a pro-Trump super PAC led by GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer, records show. He has ties to people in Trump’s circle, including Stephen K. Bannon, now serving as the president’s chief strategist and senior counselor. Prince’s sister Betsy DeVos serves as education secretary in the Trump administration. And Prince was seen in the Trump transition offices in New York in December. U.S. officials said the FBI has been scrutinizing the Seychelles meeting as part of a broader probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and alleged contacts between associates of Putin and Trump. The FBI declined to comment. The Seychelles encounter, which one official said spanned two days, adds to an expanding web of connections between Russia and Americans with ties to Trump — contacts that the White House has been reluctant to acknowledge or explain until they have been exposed by news organizations. “We are not aware of any meetings, and Erik Prince had no role in the transition,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. A Prince spokesman said in a statement: “Erik had no role on the transition team. This is a complete fabrication. The meeting had nothing to do with President Trump. Why is the so-called under-resourced intelligence community messing around with surveillance of American citizens when they should be hunting terrorists?” Prince is best known as the founder of Blackwater, a security firm that became a symbol of U.S. abuses in Iraq after a series of incidents, including one in 2007 in which the company’s guards were accused — and later criminally convicted — of killing civilians in a crowded Iraqi square. Prince sold the firm, which was subsequently re-branded, but has continued building a private paramilitary empire with contracts across the Middle East and Asia. He now heads a Hong Kong-based company known as the Frontier Services Group. Prince would probably have been seen as too controversial to serve in any official capacity in the Trump transition or administration. But his ties to Trump advisers, experience with clandestine work and relationship with the royal leaders of the Emirates — where he moved in 2010 amid mounting legal problems for his American business — would have positioned him as an ideal go-between. The Seychelles meeting came after separate private discussions in New York involving high-ranking representatives of Trump with both Moscow and the Emirates. The White House has acknowledged that Michael T. Flynn, Trump’s original national security adviser, and Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, in late November or early December in New York. Team Trump’s ties to Russian interests View Graphic Team Trump’s ties to Russian interests Flynn and Kushner were joined by Bannon for a separate meeting with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who made an undisclosed visit to New York later in December, according to the U.S., European and Arab officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. In an unusual breach of protocol, the UAE did not notify the Obama administration in advance of the visit, though officials found out because Zayed’s name appeared on a flight manifest. Officials said Zayed and his brother, the UAE’s national security adviser, coordinated the Seychelles meeting with Russian government officials with the goal of establishing an unofficial back channel between Trump and Putin. Officials said Zayed wanted to be helpful to both leaders, who had talked about working more closely together, a policy objective long advocated by the crown prince. The UAE, which sees Iran as one of its main enemies, also shared the Trump team’s interest in finding ways to drive a wedge between Moscow and Tehran. Zayed met twice with Putin in 2016, according to Western officials, and urged the Russian leader to work more closely with the Emirates and Saudi Arabia — an effort to isolate Iran. At the time of the Seychelles meeting and for weeks afterward, the UAE believed that Prince had the blessing of the new administration to act as its unofficial representative. The Russian participant was a person whom Zayed knew was close to Putin from his interactions with both men, the officials said. Scrutiny over Russia When the Seychelles meeting took place, official contacts between members of the incoming Trump administration and the Russian government were under intense scrutiny, both from federal investigators and the press. Less than a week before the Seychelles meeting, U.S. intelligence agencies released a report accusing Russia of intervening clandestinely during the 2016 election to help Trump win the White House. The FBI was already investigating communications between Flynn and Kislyak. The Washington Post’s David Ignatius first disclosed those communications on Jan. 12, around the time of the Seychelles meeting. Flynn was subsequently fired by Trump for misleading Vice President Pence and others about his discussions with Kislyak. Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, declined to comment. Government officials in the Seychelles said they were not aware of any meetings between Trump and Putin associates in the country around Jan. 11. But they said luxury resorts on the island are ideal for clandestine gatherings like the one described by the U.S., European and Arab officials. “I wouldn’t be surprised at all,” said Barry Faure, the Seychelles secretary of state for foreign affairs. “The Seychelles is the kind of place where you can have a good time away from the eyes of the media. That’s even printed in our tourism marketing. But I guess this time you smelled something.” Trump has dismissed the investigations of Russia’s role in the election as “fake news” and a “witch hunt.” The level of discretion surrounding the Seychelles meeting seems extraordinary given the frequency with which senior Trump advisers, including Flynn and Kushner, had interacted with Russian officials in the United States, including at the high-profile Trump Tower in New York. Steven Simon, a National Security Council senior director for the Middle East and North Africa in the Obama White House, said: “The idea of using business cutouts, or individuals perceived to be close to political leaders, as a tool of diplomacy is as old as the hills. These unofficial channels are desirable precisely because they are deniable; ideas can be tested without the risk of failure.” Current and former U.S. officials said that while Prince refrained from playing a direct role in the Trump transition, his name surfaced so frequently in internal discussions that he seemed to function as an outside adviser whose opinions were valued on a range of issues, including plans for overhauling the U.S. intelligence community. He appears to have particularly close ties to Bannon, appearing multiple times on the Breitbart satellite radio program and website that Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign. In a July interview with Bannon, Prince said those seeking forceful U.S. leadership should “wait till January and hope Mr. Trump is elected.” And he lashed out at President Barack Obama, saying that because of his policies “the terrorists, the fascists, are winning.” Days before the November election, Prince appeared on the Breitbart radio program, saying that he had “well-placed sources” in the New York City Police Department telling him they were preparing to make arrests in the investigation of former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) over allegations he exchanged sexually explicit texts with a minor. Flynn tweeted a link to the Breitbart report on the claim. No arrests occurred. Prince went on to make unfounded assertions that damaging material recovered from Weiner’s computers would implicate Hillary Clinton and her close adviser, Huma Abedin, who was married to Weiner. He also called Abedin an “agent of influence very sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.” Prince and his family were major GOP donors in 2016. The Center for Responsive Politics reported that the family gave more than $10 million to GOP candidates and super PACs, including about $2.7 million from his sister, DeVos, and her husband. Prince’s father, Edgar Prince, built his fortune through an auto-parts company. Betsy married Richard DeVos Jr., heir to the Amway fortune. Erik Prince has had lucrative contracts with the UAE government, which at one point paid his firm a reported $529 million to help bring in foreign fighters to help assemble an internal paramilitary force capable of carrying out secret operations and protecting Emirati installations from terrorist attacks. Focus on Iran The Trump administration and the UAE appear to share a similar preoccupation with Iran. Current and former officials said that Trump advisers were focused throughout the transition period on exploring ways to get Moscow to break ranks with Tehran. “Separating Russia from Iran was a common theme,” said a former intelligence official in the Obama administration who met with Trump transition officials. “It didn’t seem very well thought out. It seemed a little premature. They clearly had a very specific policy position, which I found odd given that they hadn’t even taken the reins and explored with experts in the U.S. government the pros and cons of that approach.” Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said he also had discussions with people close to the Trump administration about the prospects of drawing Russia away from Iran. “When I would hear this, I would think, ‘Yeah that’s great for you guys, but why would Putin ever do that?’ ” McFaul said. “There is no interest in Russia ever doing that. They have a long relationship with Iran. They’re allied with Iran in fighting in Syria. They sell weapons to Iran. Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the Middle East.” Following the New York meeting between the Emiratis and Trump aides, Zayed was approached by Prince, who said he was authorized to act as an unofficial surrogate for the president-elect, according to the officials. He wanted Zayed to set up a meeting with a Putin associate. Zayed agreed and proposed the Seychelles as the meeting place because of the privacy it would afford both sides. “He wanted to be helpful,” one official said of Zayed. Wealthy Russians and Emirati royalty have a particularly large footprint on the islands. Signs advertising deep-sea fishing trips are posted in Cyrillic. Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov owns North Island, where Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, went on their honeymoon in 2011. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, president of the UAE, built a hilltop palace for himself with views across the chain of islands. The Emiratis have given hundreds of millions of dollars to the Seychelles in recent years for causes including public health and affordable housing. But when the Emirati royal family visits, they are rarely seen. “The jeep comes to their private jet on the tarmac and they disappear,” said one Seychellois official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be seen as criticizing the Emiratis. Zayed, the crown prince, owns a share of the Seychelles’ Four Seasons, a collection of private villas scattered on a lush hillside on the main island’s southern shore, overlooking the Indian Ocean, according to officials in the Seychelles.

      "text" : "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Just hours before North Korea fired a failed ballistic missile, President Trump spent his morning enjoying the blue, breezy weather here on Florida’s eastern coast Saturday, zipping around the greens of his private golf club. The day before, the president also passed the morning playing golf at Trump International Golf Club, according to someone who saw him on the course. And in addressing North Korea’s latest provocation, Trump — who spent at least a portion of both evenings greeting guests at his private Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach — deferred to his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general. “The president and his military team are aware of North Korea’s most recent unsuccessful missile launch,” Mattis said in a ­two-sentence, emailed statement Saturday night. “The president has no further comment.” On the question of North Korea, one of the United States’ most immediate geopolitical threats, Trump was uncharacteristically quiet over the weekend, instead leaving it to his team of deputies, as well as Vice President Pence, to articulate the administration’s policy toward the totalitarian regime. Administration officials, lawmakers react after failed North Korean missile launch Embed Copy Share Play Video2:03 (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) National security adviser H.R.

Korea didn’t test a nuclear weapon, but it did try to launch another missile] In addition to Mattis’s terse statement, the vice president — who arrived in Seoul for a 10-day trip through Asia shortly after the failed launch — briefly addressed North Korea’s latest action at a dinner for U.S. troops and their family members. A White House foreign policy adviser on the trip briefed reporters traveling with Pence as well. “This morning’s provocation from the north is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face each and every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defense of America in this part of the world,” Pence said. “Your willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear, inspires.” Mattis’s statement, as well as Trump’s lack of comment Saturday night, stood in stark contrast with the president’s behavior just two months ago, when North Korea claimed in mid-February that it had successfully tested a new type of missile with nuclear capabilities. In response then, Trump — who was again at Mar-a-Lago for a visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — scrambled his traveling press corps to deliver an in-person statement that evening after he and his aides seemed to pore over the latest developments in full view of his club members. But as tensions mounted earlier in the week between the United States and North Korea — which is forging ahead with its nuclear weapons program and is eager to build a missile that can reach the United States — the president departed the White House on Thursday for what he seemed to hope would be a quiet Easter weekend holiday. He brought with him only three junior staffers and K.T. McFarland, a deputy national security adviser who Trump aides said may soon be nominated as ambassador to Singapore in a move many view as a demotion. 1 of 85 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × EmbedCopyShare See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The beginning of his term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

But in the hours after the failed launch, Trump — who previously has said the United States is willing to intervene on its own if others in the region don’t step up — allowed his advisers, including McFarland and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, to outline the administration’s approach on the Sunday talk shows. McMaster and McFarland offered a notable contrast to Trump’s previously bellicose statements. Both seemed to be calling for patience and tamped down the possibility of imminent military intervention. McMaster, appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” said that the United States is exploring “a range of options” to respond to an increasingly provocative North Korea but that the administration would like “to take action short of armed conflict, so we can avoid the worst.” McFarland, meanwhile, played down the significance of yet another failed North Korean missile launch, saying that the test early Sunday was “not a surprise.” “Even in the last year, President Kim of North Korea has launched over 30 missiles,” McFarland said. “Most of them have failed. So it didn’t come as a surprise to us. We were expecting something surrounding the birthday of his grandfather.” Saturday was the anniversary of the 1912 birth of Kim Il Sung, North Korea’s founder and the current leader’s grandfather. McMaster and McFarland also talked up the role China could play in bringing North Korea to heel — and urged some patience on that front. About 80 percent of North Korea’s trade is with neighboring China, giving the country a good deal of leverage, they suggested. McFarland said an array of strategies were discussed when Chinese President Xi Jinping recently visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago. “It’s like your kids in the back of the car on a long trip saying, ‘When are we going to get there?’ ” McFarland said. “Well, in this case, I think we should give the Chinese president some opportunities and some time, as well as pursuing the economic and diplomatic pressures that we have and that our allies have that we can bring to bear on North Korea.” Trump, who save for muscling Justice Neil M. Gorsuch onto the Supreme Court has no real achievements on Capitol Hill of which to boast, has weathered several national security and military crises fewer than 100 days into his presidency, and seems to enjoy both the process and the projection of strength such crises involve. After Syrian President Bashar al-Assad deployed chemical weapons against his own people, Trump worked with his military advisers and responded swiftly, firing 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield. Aides to the president said he enjoyed the orderly process, overseen by McMaster, which resembled the streamlined operations of a more traditional White House, with Trump requesting a range of responses and each adviser weighing in with their expertise before the president made a final decision. But Trump seemed determined to avoid conflict of just about any sort this weekend — North Korea or otherwise. He spent his three days in Palm Beach shuttling between Mar-a-Lago and Trump International Golf Club, spending almost no time outside the cocoon of his two palm-tree-lined properties. On Saturday, after golf, the president’s motorcade took a different, longer route than usual to return to his private club, coming back from the north and along the coast. The circuitous trip allowed Trump to avoid the protesters who had gathered along the main thoroughfare just west of Mar-a-Lago to call on him to release his tax returns. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the route was determined by the Secret Service. Trump, a normally prolific — and brash — user of Twitter, also spent the weekend largely quiet on social media; his last tweet heading into the weekend concerned his enthusiasm about the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday. On Sunday morning, Trump briefly took to Twitter, boasting about his electoral college victory in the 2016 presidential election and asking why his tax returns mattered in light of his win. He also extolled his efforts to rebuild the military.

See all newsletters He also seemed to admit he was using the Treasury Department’s currency report — which did not label China a currency manipulator — as a political bargaining weapon. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would brand China a currency manipulator on Day One of his administration. On Day 83, he officially backed off that course. “Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korea problem?” he wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “We will see what happens!” But then the president retreated back into his calm Palm Beach world. He attended Easter services at Bethesda-by-the-Sea church here with his wife, Melania, son Barron, and daughter from his second marriage, ­Tiffany, before returning to Mar-a-Lago for an annual brunch and Easter egg hunt with his eldest sons, Don Jr. and Eric, and their families, according to an aide. One intrusion from the outside world came from Don Jr., who over the weekend was sporting a green T-shirt that read “Very Fake News” in block white letters — a reminder of all those who, the president believes, have treated him so unfairly.",

      "text" : "President Trump’s decision this week to launch airstrikes against the Syrian regime has come as a bitter disappointment to those who cast their votes last November for “America First”-style isolationism. But the betrayal shouldn’t come as a surprise. While this episode may have been the one to finally debunk the pundit-pleasing myth of “Donald the Dove,” the truth is that Trump’s mutation into a missile-lobbing interventionist was, most likely, always inevitable.That’s because, as with everything else, Trump’s approach to matters of war and peace appears to be more attitudinal than philosophical—motivated by instinct, manifested in tough talk, and rooted in a worldview that holds up the cultivation of fear as the most effective way to win respect and obedience.Though Trump lacks the level of knowledge and grasp of history necessary to form an all-encompassing foreign policy doctrine, he has consistently articulated a belief that America’s enemies around the world can be terrified into submission—if the commander-in-chief is willing to send a strong message. Even if Trump had opted to stay out of the Syrian conflict, that belief of his—paired with a general aversion to the compromises of diplomacy—likely would have led him to abandon whatever isolationist tendencies he harbored sooner or later.Trump made little effort during the campaign to conceal the contradictions inherent to his isolationist posture and his crowd-pleasing saber-rattling. “We’re fighting a very politically correct war,” he said in one interview. “We’re not taking it to [ISIS], and we have to take it to them,” he said in another. During a NBC News forum last September, Trump said, “I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point where it's embarrassing to our country. ... And I can just see the great, as an example, Gen. George Patton spinning in his grave as ISIS, we can't beat.\"To right the ship, Trump repeatedly declared on the campaign trail—in his trademark bellicose style—that he would be much tougher on foreign enemies and adversaries than past presidents have been. He gleefully pledged to “bomb the shit out of” ISIS-controlled oil wells and then make off with the oil. He flaunted his support for the use of torture, and ridiculed anyone who opposed it. On multiple occasions, he said he would deter and demoralize terrorists by killing their families. If Trump was anti-war, he seemed decidedly pro-war-crimes. In one particularly vivid example, Trump told a story (which turned out to be apocryphal) about former U.S. Army General John Pershing summarily executing Muslim prisoners with bullets soaked in pig’s blood. “He had his men load his rifles and he lined up the fifty people, and they shot 49 of those people,” Trump told a crowd in South Carolina. “And the fiftieth person he said ‘You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.’” For Trump, the moral of the story was in the kicker: “And for 25 years there wasn’t a problem, okay?”Whether it happened this week or next, in Syria or someplace else, the president was bound to disappoint his isolationist supporters sooner or later.Beyond fighting terrorism, Trump has often said the U.S. needs to be more “unpredictable” on the world stage. While running for president, he pointedly refused to take the potential use of nuclear weapons off the table, even in places like Europe. That probably wasn’t because he had big plans to bomb Estonia; it was because he wanted to place as few constraints on himself as possible, believing that the more nervous he made the world as commander-in-chief, the less likely it was that adversaries would mess with America. Some have identified this approach as a return to the “Madman Theory,” Richard Nixon’s belief that if his enemies thought he was unbalanced, he would have a stronger negotiating position against China on the Vietnam War.But, of course, Trump does not have Nixon’s discipline or depth of knowledge, nor does he have George W. Bush’s level of conviction, or Barack Obama’s cerebral patience—all qualities that could have come in handy for a president who hoped to defy the vast Washington establishment in pursuit of a radical departure from foreign policy orthodoxy. Instead, Trump entered the Oval Office with a bone-deep belief in vengeance, a tendency toward impulsiveness, and a history of saber-rattling rhetoric.There are strong arguments for and against Trump’s decision to intervene in Syria. But whether it happened this week or next, in Syria or someplace else, the president was bound to disappoint his isolationist supporters sooner or later.",

      "text" : "Tom Perez speaks in Washington in January 2016. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) PORTLAND, Maine — When Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez arrived at the State Theatre on Monday night, David Bright would be there. Bright, an organic farmer who helped Sanders win the state’s Democratic caucuses, was one of Maine’s four voters in the electoral college. He’d used that role to cast a protest vote for Sanders, relenting and casting a futile vote for Hillary Clinton only after state law forced him to. His opinion of the Democratic Party’s “establishment” has not improved much since then. “The DNC has dropped the ball on one congressional campaign after another,” Bright said in an interview before driving from his farm to Portland. “The only way Perez would be safe to come to Maine is to have Bernie by his side. Otherwise, progressives in this state would tear him apart.” Portland, the bluest dot in a state that has trended Republican in recent years, is the launchpad for a week-long Perez-Sanders campaign tour. The team-up came last month, but last week, when Democrats lost a closer-than-expected House race in Kansas, the reasons for doing it became clearer. While energy on the left has risen since November, the party’s base can still tumble into debates about whom to blame for its defeats, with the left doing most of the talking. The Perez-Sanders tour will not go through any state holding a congressional election soon, though it will boost Heath Mello, the Democrat running for mayor of Omaha. In an interview Monday morning on NPR, Perez praised Mello and said that Democrats had contributed to the Kansas race in ways that perhaps had gone unseen. “We invested in the following ways: When people were out there knocking on doors, they were using the DNC’s voter file,” he said. “We were monitoring the election very closely with the state party. We did robo-calls at their request.” Pointing to the 20-point swing toward Democrats, Perez said that “if we replicate that success everywhere, we will flip the House in 2018.” James Thompson, the Kansas Democrat who lost last week, wrote on Twitter that disappointed progressives should focus on upcoming races instead of casting blame. Colin Curtis, Thompson’s campaign manager, said that “some people just want to be angry” and that while the Democratic Party support had been pro forma, it hadn’t been a surprise. “Do I wish they would have come in earlier? Sure,” Curtis said. “But at the end of the day we didn’t plan on them doing it.” Progressives were not just critical of the party’s spending — they were critical of its messaging. Brett Vars, a 23-year-old who works at a grocery store outside Maine’s largest city, showed up to the State Theatre seven hours before Sanders was set to speak. He liked Perez’s record as labor secretary but was disappointed with how he talked about the Democratic Party, with lines about “leading with our values” that did not get into policy. In 2016, he voted for the Green Party’s Jill Stein for president. He was hopeful about Democrats but also interested in Maine’s new ranked-choice voting law, which could benefit a left-wing third party. “It would be interesting to see what the Green Party could do if it got some power,” Vars said. Further down the line outside the theater — which stretched for blocks down Portland’s Congress Street — a 59-year old Mainer named Soni Biehl was encouraging the rally’s attendees to stay outside of the Democratic Party. She was one of several petitioners for a “Draft Bernie” campaign which would encourage the Vermont senator to seek the presidency in 2020 as an independent. The Democratic Party, she explained, was broken in ways its leaders did not know how to fix. “What did they do with Debbie Wasserman Schultz? Nothing,” said Biehl, referring to the former chair of the DNC. When asked if the party had disciplined her by making her resign, in a minor crisis moment during the party’s convention, Biehl explained that Wasserman Schultz “should have been fired.” powerpost powerpost false endOfArticle true The Daily 202 newsletter A must-read morning briefing for decision-makers.

After the State’s stage filled with volunteers, mostly young, a heckler yelled “Why aren’t the Bernie delegates up there?” (Some of the senator’s 2016 delegates were in a special seating area, with VIP badges.) A local Democratic Party leader said that the “the new chair,” meaning Perez, would be arriving soon — there were a handful of booze. A state senator told the crowd that the political system was rigged; a heckler yelled, “like the primary!” But those sentiments were largely drowned out by active Democrats, who cheered for local Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Me.) — a former president of the progressive Common Cause, and a supporter of single-payer health care. Pingree roused the crowd in boos for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, the fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and a president who was “dropping bombs and making threats on Twitter” while blocking Syrian refugees from the country. “He doesn’t seem to remember that the Constitution requires him to ask Congress for an authorization of military force,” said Pingree to cheers. Michael Blake, a New York assemblyman and newly elected DNC vice chair, brought the crowd to a roar with a similar indictment of Trump. “We can’t keep right-fighting the primary,” he said offstage.",

      "text" : "Two days after the November election, leaders of President Trump’s transition team presented his inner circle with more than 100 names of candidates for key Cabinet and other senior positions in the new administration. Missing from the list for the post of national security adviser was retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, according to two knowledgeable officials. Flynn was a loyalist who had a close relationship with Trump. It was obvious to the transition team that Trump would give him a prominent appointment. But among some of those tasked with bringing forward prospective candidates, there was a belief that Flynn was ill-suited for the critically important job of coordinating national security policy in the new White House. Trump, however, had his own list of candidates, and Flynn was at the top. Eleven days after winning the election, he announced Flynn as his choice. Twenty-four days after Trump was sworn in as president, Flynn was forced out for having misled Vice President Pence and others about communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn later acknowledged that he had worked on behalf of the Turkish government while serving as a campaign adviser. Last week, through his lawyer, he offered to testify, in exchange for immunity, in the ongoing investigations of Russian interference in the election. Viewed through the lens of the first months of the new administration, Trump’s transition provided the template for what has unfolded since Inauguration Day on personnel and other matters. No transition goes exactly as planned, but Trump’s proved messier than most, and that has carried over into the first months of his presidency. Lawmakers face new questions on Russia probe after Flynn’s immunity request Embed Copy Share Play Video2:38 (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Lawmakers of both parties on April 2 faced new questions on congressional probes of Russian meddling in the 2016 election after Michael Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, offered to testify in exchange for immunity.

(Video: Bastien Inzaurralde/Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Throughout the campaign, Trump took a hands-off approach to transition preparations. It was bad karma, he believed, to start planning a presidency before he won the election. Once elected, he decided to run things his own way. “It went off the rails almost immediately after the election,” said one knowledgeable person who declined to be identified to offer a candid assessment [Trump remains the center of attention — but politically he is increasingly isolated] One effect was that the Trump team could not scale up quickly enough during the transition and therefore failed to maintain a full pipeline of appointees for the new administration. The Partnership for Public Service, in collaboration with The Washington Post, has been tracking 553 key administration positions that require Senate confirmation. To date, just 21 nominees have been confirmed and another 44 await confirmation. The pace of critical subcabinet appointments remains a serious problem, with many agencies still sparsely populated at the top. An administration official said announcements generally have been held back until proper vetting can take place, which did not occur during the transition. The hope is that, once nominated, confirmations can be completed more quickly. Trump’s management preferences, honed in his business, also overrode the recommendation of some transition planners for a White House structured with clear lines of authority and a strong chief of staff. That structure was meant to discipline the president’s mercurial style. Instead, Trump created a White House of multiple and competing power centers, personal rivalries and internal conflict. Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, a nonpartisan organization that aids new administrations, said that course was set when Trump named Reince Priebus as chief of staff and in the same release named Stephen K. Bannon as senior counselor and chief strategist. “You knew right there that was going to be a White House that was not going to be organized in a regular hierarchical fashion, as most Republicans develop them,” Kumar said. “You knew there that was going to be a White House where conflict was going to be something the president saw as positive.” Bannon predicts there will be an ideological 'fight every day' Embed Copy Share Play Video1:34 (The Washington Post) White House chief strategist Stephen K.

(Photo: Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) Kumar noted one other thing about the transition that has plagued the administration since Inauguration Day: The president’s habit of continuing to raise grievances about the campaign. “He couldn’t leave the election behind and it’s still been difficult for him,” she said. Trump’s transition was the first one conducted after passage of the Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 and the operation did much good work, both in the pre-election planning and in preparing for a new administration after the election. The team combed through almost 87,000 resumes, identified more than 500 people to go into agencies after Inauguration Day, conducted hundreds of interviews of prospective nominees and established new procedures from which future transitions could profit. Those kinds of accomplishments led Ken Nahigian, who played a central role in both the pre-election and post-election phases, to say, “This transition was as smooth and well executed as we ever could have expected.” [Flynn told Trump he might register as a foreign agent] But the transition operated as two units, one based in Washington where the bulk of the staff was based, and the other at Trump Tower, where the president-elect and his top campaign advisers were located. “The operation went forward, but it wasn’t connected to the decision-makers,” said Max Stier, the president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service. He added that, despite the planning done ahead of the election, Trump and his inner circle “created a decisional process that was opaque and held by a few people.” On Election Day, Trump’s transition advisers presented the president-elect’s inner circle with 30 binders of materials. One binder provided the overview and outlined detailed recommendations for the 73-day presidential transition then commencing. This was to serve as a road map designed to assure, to the extent possible, an orderly start for the new administration. A copy of that transition planning material was provided to The Post. The documents included proposed hour-by-hour schedules for the president-elect as he began the transition; week-by-week transition messaging themes aimed at highlighting Trump’s campaign promises; ambitious timetables for completing congressional action on those promises; drafts of executive orders; policy backgrounders; a lengthy memo analyzing a White House staff structure; and landing teams assigned to key executive branch agencies, most approved by members of Trump’s family. The materials represented the fruits of months of work by Trump’s transition team. Then, days after the election, the transition took an unexpected turn. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the transition chairman, was removed from his position and replaced by then-vice president-elect Pence. Christie friends say he was the victim of a power play by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and the husband of Ivanka Trump, and was told that when he was informed of the change. As U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Christie had been involved in the prosecution of Kushner’s father, which resulted in a jail sentence. At the time of Christie’s demotion last November, transition spokesman Jason Miller said reports that Kushner had pushed him aside “couldn’t be further from the truth.” Some of Trump’s close advisers had concerns that pre-election convictions of former Christie allies Bill Baroni and Bridget Kelly in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal tarnished Christie and would reflect badly on Trump. Baroni and Kelly were sentenced to prison terms last week. Some Trump loyalists simply didn’t trust Christie, whom they saw as still bitter that he had not been picked as Trump’s running mate. Another charge was that the work was not being done at the rate it needed to be, although a summary document presented to Trump’s inner circle the day before the election showed no area where the transition was behind schedule. There also were reports that the transition staff and volunteers were stocked with Washington lobbyists. There were lobbyists among those recruited during the fall, but according to four knowledgeable officials, the transition moved to bar them after Trump delivered his “drain the swamp speech” in October. “When he put down the rule about lobbyists, we adjusted,” one of the officials said. “I personally made a presentation on November 11th to 200 to 250 transition employees and volunteers, including potential members of landing teams,” said William Palatucci, who served as transition general counsel and was a longtime Christie confidant. “If you wanted to be part of the transition team and on a landing team, there was a lobbying ban.” There also were prohibitions against working for a foreign government, as it turned out Flynn had been doing. [Trump and his advisers can’t keep quiet, and it’s becoming a problem] Although Trump remained aloof from the transition team, his family provided oversight on his behalf. Transition leaders met weekly with an executive committee composed of Trump’s children Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric, as well as Kushner and other campaign officials. The original transition blueprint was ambitious and detailed. “The day after Election Day— Day Next —the presidential transition will launch in the form of a shadow White House and will function through the 73-day period leading up to the Inauguration,” according to the overview briefing book. While acknowledging there could only be one president at a time, the transition document proposed “a strategic approach that departs from the historical precedent of ‘laying low’ during the presidential transition.” At times, Trump simply ignored the recommendations. The transition team wanted Trump to observe Veterans Day by flying to Washington for a possible event at the World War II Memorial. As one person with close knowledge of the transition put it, “You come with a plan and he modifies it. He’s the boss.” The legislative timetable was hugely ambitious. One transition document, for example, called for Congress to complete work on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act by Feb. 24, or Day 36 of the administration. The GOP health-care bill wasn’t even introduced by that date and was pulled from a House vote last month after meeting fierce resistance, even from many Republicans. politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters The transition team had prepared lists of prospective candidates not only for the Cabinet but for many of the other senior positions throughout the executive branch, about 300 or so in all. The sequencing was designed to provide a steady stream of personnel decisions to assure that the new administration would be able to populate the upper ranks of executive branch agencies as rapidly as possible. Ahead of the election, transition leaders spent two full days culling longer lists of names to between four and six for each key position. Prospective candidates recommended for national security adviser included retired general James Mattis, who was selected for defense secretary; retired Marine general Peter Pace; retired Navy admiral and current University of Texas chancellor William H. McRaven, who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden; and K.T. McFarland, the current deputy national security adviser. Flynn was penciled in as a possible director of national intelligence, for which transition officials believed he was better suited than national security adviser. Cabinet selections were to be made quickly after the election but withheld until at least Thanksgiving. “We wanted him to make [Cabinet] selections privately so we could do vetting privately before announcements,” said one official with knowledge of the process who declined to be identified to share private information. Instead of an orderly rollout, however, the process quickly went Trumpian. Candidates were called to meet with Trump at Trump Tower or at his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., in a process that critics likened to a reality television show. Announcements sometimes were made through press release rather than by the candidate in a public setting. The process rather than the announcements became the theater — and the narrative.",

      "text" : "Getty 1600 Penn Friends and foes imagine his options for brutal payback. By Ben SchreckingerApril 14, 2017When Steve Bannon vacated a home in Florida in 2015, his landlord complained that an entire Jacuzzi had apparently been coated in acid. After conservative media star Dana Loesch left Bannon’s employ at Breitbart News in 2012, she filed a suit against the website, alleging a plot to “sabotage” her career. When Bannon failed to take over the Biosphere 2 ecology experiment in 1993, he “vowed profanely to take revenge” on a scientist who crossed him, according to the woman’s lawyer. And when Bannon was breaking up with his second wife, she accused him of grabbing her by the throat and threatening to take away their children, while his lawyer reportedly threatened that she would end up with “no money” if the resultant domestic abuse case went to trial.Parting ways with Donald Trump’s chief strategist, it seems, is rarely a simple proposition. But with Trump undercutting Bannon in recent interviews and speculation running rampant that he could soon lose his job amid vicious West Wing infighting, the White House may soon be doing just that.Story Continued BelowI asked friends and foes alike to imagine how, should Bannon get the boot, the pugnacious populist might exact his revenge.Taken together, their suggestions amount to an epic, Kill Bill-style revenge saga that starts with Bannon leaking personal dirt on his enemies to the tabloids, using the megaphone of Breitbart News to exacerbate divisions inside the administration, and siccing an army of internet trolls on his adversaries to harass and defame them. It ends with Bannon using Cambridge Analytica data to identify and primary their vulnerable allies in Congress, then releasing a “Where Trump Went Wrong” documentary on the eve of the November midterms and finally—in this revenge fantasy’s epic climax—running against Trump himself in 2020.Neither Bannon, who has shown no signs of disloyalty to the president, nor the White House responded to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Bannon and the Mercer family, his patrons, declined to comment on the record, but there is little expectation among those who have tangled with him that the White House’s chief strategist — a guy who has been known to say things like “burn the boats” and “I love a gunfight” — intends to go gentle into that good night.Indeed, the situation has become so “volatile” that the normally loquacious Iowa Congressman Steve King, a steadfast Bannon ally in the House, declined to weigh in, citing fears that the mere discussion of Bannon’s potential revenge could be enough to set off Trump while also acknowledging that it could have the opposite effect of making the White House think twice about firing him. “Even comments by me could cause a lot of problems,” King said. “It’s better for the country if my voice isn’t in it.”Others were less hesitant. “It’s not like it’s definitely going to be ‘Apocalypse Now,’ but it could be, and that’s the point,” said a close Bannon ally. “Do you really want to gamble with this in your first 100 days?”“He’ll have his minions eviscerate you on Twitter and write articles with fake information. You will be attacked and lied about,” said Republican operative Cheri Jacobus, who was the subject of critical coverage in Breitbart in 2015 after saying Trump was popular with “low-information voters” and who blames Breitbart for a campaign of online harassment she has endured since then.“Bannon can launch something, and there’s an army of people who are part of the alt-right that will then pick up on it and they know what to do,” Jacobus said. “It’s like a chain reaction.”Jacobus is just one of a number of Republican operatives and conservative pundits who blame Breitbart coverage for stirring up a tsunami of threats and intimidation from its readers after drawing the outlet’s ire during Bannon’s tenure there. Republican operative Rick Wilson, for example, reportedly endured anonymous threats to rape his daughter and nearly shot a man he found snooping on his back porch after becoming the subject of numerous Breitbart stories.Should Bannon return to the outlet, which he led from 2012 until he joined the Trump campaign in August, some former colleagues expect him to once again prosecute his grudges through its coverage.“The hit pieces on Breitbart will increase, for sure,” said Loesch, who clashed with Bannon after leaving Breitbart to work for his nemesis Glenn Beck at The Blaze.“I don’t believe that he ever really stopped being at the helm of Breitbart,” said Kurt Bardella, who quit his job as a spokesman for the news organization last spring in protest of Bannon’s handling of an assault allegation lodged by then-Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields against then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. (Breitbart recently released a letter showing that Bannon formally resigned from the news outlet shortly after Election Day.)While Breitbart Washington bureau chief and Bannon protégé Matt Boyle has reportedly ordered the site’s reporters to stop targeting Kushner (Boyle denies it), Bardella cited one recent 24-hour period in which the site published four anti-Kushner pieces. “It’ll look like that,” he said.Jacobus said she expects Bannon would use his knowledge of the White House’s internal dynamics to drum up stories that exacerbate existing rivalries.Meanwhile, Bannon could launder more salacious hits through the tabloids. “You go National Enquirer on them,” said blogger Mike Cernovich, a self-described student of Bannon’s work who said he has discussed the eventuality of Bannon’s firing with people close to him.“There’s sex scandals people are sitting on,” Cernovich said. “All the gossip and drama and stuff that might be a little more personal is going to get leaked.”Trump mega-donor Rebekah Mercer, Bannon’s chief patron, spent much of Friday at the offices of Cambridge Analytica — a data firm in which her family is invested and on whose board Bannon sat before joining the White House — exploring potential gigs for Bannon should he be fired, according to The New York Times.Cernovich speculated that Bannon could, with the help of Cambridge Analytica’s data, move from the personal to the political by identifying his enemies’ most vulnerable allies in Congress and encouraging challengers to run for their seats. “There will be big primary campaigns against them,” Cernovich said. “It will be Eric Cantor-style warfare.”Several people familiar with Bannon’s modus operandi said he would be unlikely to take on Trump directly, preferring instead to shift blame toward others while leaving the door open to a rapprochement with the president — at least at first.“In Steve’s dream scenario, he would depart, things would fall apart even more so, and Trump would beg him to come back to fix it,” Bardella said.Otherwise, Trump could eventually find himself directly in Bannon’s cross hairs, some said.“We would see House and Senate races in 2018 to, you know, go after Trump’s agenda,” said internet troll Charles Johnson, an ally of Bannon who worked for him at Breitbart. “Everything would slow down. His presidency would essentially be over. Bannon is more than just a man. He is honestly something of an idea because he represents something that both the establishment and the left-wing media hate.”In years past, Bannon produced several political documentaries, an experience that one Breitbart insider suggested he could call on in a scorched-earth campaign against Trump.“He does have skills, like high-end skills,” said the insider. “One of his high-end skills is he could actually put together a documentary. What if he came out with something before the 2018 midterms, ‘Where Trump Went Wrong’?”If it does come to open conflict with the president himself, right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart tech editor hired by Bannon who often calls Trump a “God Emperor” and “Daddy,” made no bones about where his loyalties lie.“It will be my very great honor to manage the Bannon 2020 campaign,” he said, before sending over three mock logos for the hypothetical presidential run.Ben Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.THE BIG IDEA By Andrés Miguel RondónThe Friday Cover By Aron LundFourth Estate By Virginia Heffernan © 2017 POLITICO LLC",

Tattoo for a dying marriage: My husband and I have been married for eight years. We’ve never been really happy, and we’ve been in and out of counseling a few times. I want to get a divorce, and I am working to get everything in order financially so I can leave. We don’t have kids, so that isn’t an issue. The problem is that I’m not financially ready yet to leave, and our anniversary is coming up. My husband thinks we should get matching tattoos to prove our commitment to each other. Obviously, I don’t want to do this. But how can I say no without telling him that I’m actually planning to leave him in about six months? A: There are plenty of reasons not to get matching tattoos besides I’m secretly planning to leave you; eight years is not the “matching tattoo” anniversary, and people who decline to get joint tattoos with their spouses within the first decade of marriage are still welcomed in all arenas of society. You can tell him that you don’t like the idea, that you’ve changed your mind if you suggested you were open to it in the past, that you don’t think a tattoo is a good way to mark a commitment, that you think matching couple tattoos look bad on other people—whatever you like. Even if your husband considers the tattoos the only way to “prove” your commitment to the marriage (which is a ridiculous proposition), you don’t have to engage with him on those terms. Q. Friend wants her teenage years: I’m really worried about my friend “Laura.” Laura grew up in a conservative community and married at 18. Her husband was a family friend, and she didn’t date anybody but him. After their marriage, she went to college, had two kids, and has now divorced her husband. She has broken away from her family because she says they judge her and she is intent on living her own life. I’d be good with that if it weren’t for the fact that she thinks living her own life is doing whatever she wants regardless of the consequences. Laura goes out to bars three to four nights a week. She would leave her kids (both under age 10) home alone. The authorities were called numerous times, and now her ex-husband has custody. Laura alternates between blaming her ex for this or saying she doesn’t care because the kids kept her from doing what she wants. Over the past six months Laura has been arrested three times. She’s moved two different men into her house in that same time. One stole everything he could carry before he left. The other left when his wife came and got him. Last week Laura lost her very well-paying job because a lot of this behavior was seeping into her work life. I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried talking to her, but she insists she doesn’t have a problem. She says that all she is doing is acting like a normal teenager and since she was robbed of that during her teen years, she wants it now. Is this something she is just going to have to get through on her own? Advertisement A: None of this sounds particularly like “normal” teen behavior, and I’m not especially sympathetic to the argument that because someone had what she judged an insufficiently wild youth, she is now entitled to re-enact that time in adulthood, especially when that re-enactment involves serious child neglect. Finding yourself is one thing; multiple arrests and child abandonment is quite another. While your friend is likely going to have to deal with the fallout from her actions for a long time, you don’t have to indulge her assertion that what she’s doing is a normal consequence of having gotten married young. If she’s willing to admit she needs help, you might be able to assist her, but if what she’s looking for is someone to co-sign her illegal and negligent behavior, don’t volunteer.

The catch is he smokes pot regularly, and I am a holdover from the “just say no” era. I’ve mentioned I’m not comfortable with it, and he agreed not to smoke around me or get high before we hang out. Before deciding if this is a deal-breaker, what can I do to challenge my beliefs? Am I as outdated as I think I might be? A: I don’t know if you’re interested in learning more about weed smoking and re-examining your beliefs about it because you’re genuinely not sure why you still hold said beliefs or if you’re looking for a way to pretend it doesn’t bother you because you really like this guy and don’t want to seem like a buzzkill. If it’s the former, try doing some research (there are plenty of resources online that can elucidate the virtues of marijuana, I promise—plenty of them reputable, even) or speaking with the growers at your local dispensary, if you have one. You might even ask this dude to tell you more about his experience smoking weed, what he likes about it, and what benefits he experiences. If, however, as I suspect, you are looking for ways to convince yourself you don’t mind something you actually do just because you like this guy, I don’t think you should worry too much about “challenging your beliefs.” He’s not just an occasional smoker; he gets high regularly, and the promise he’s made to never be or get high around you is one that is only going to get more difficult if you two start seeing each other regularly. This might not be a workable compromise if you’re genuinely uncomfortable being around someone who’s high. Weed can be great for some people, some of the time! It’s also not a cure-all, and it’s not right for everybody. It’s also perfectly OK to not like weed or its effects and to not want to date someone who smokes it regularly. Advertisement Your attitude isn’t necessarily “outdated” in part because weed isn’t new; attitudes and certain legal prohibitions have changed drastically in parts of this country over the past 25 years, but that doesn’t mean that people who don’t like weed are going to have to start dating stoners or else be judged stone-age relics. Think about what you’re really looking for in a partner—not what you think you should be looking for out of fear of being uptight—and be honest about it. If that could potentially include this guy, great, go for it. If you don’t think it does, look elsewhere. It doesn’t mean either of you is wrong, just that you two aren’t right for each other.

Q. Not my dogs: My husband took in his adult daughter’s two dogs for a week while she was moving—not a problem. Then my stepdaughter’s living situation changed, and she is now rooming with people who don’t allow pets. I warned my husband that I wasn’t going to live with these animals past spring. Either my stepdaughter would take responsibly, or he would. She cried, he caved, and now we are fighting. I work 60-hour weeks. I did not assume pet responsibility when my son was 6; I am not doing it for my grown husband. He wants me to feed, walk, and clean up after the dogs on my lunch break since I work closer. I refused, and he had to hire someone. He doesn’t like the animals and hates walking them after work. They have ruined the rug in his office and the door to the backyard. He complains to me, and I tell him I don’t want to hear it. He went against my wishes here and knows what I think he should do. My question is: How do I get through to him? He is grumpy all the time.

Your husband’s decision is just that—his decision—and you’ve been clear from the start that you’re not interested in becoming a long-term pet owner and that he and his daughter need to work together to make alternate arrangements for these dogs. She’s an adult and the one who decided to get the dogs in the first place. If she’s no longer able to keep them with her, then she should be working with him in looking for a long-term solution. When your husband tries to complain to you, say, “I’m sorry this situation is so difficult for you, but you made a choice, and you and your daughter need to figure out appropriate next steps if taking care of these dogs is getting to be too much for you. Let me know if you need help finding resources in rehoming them, and I’ll be happy to help; otherwise, let’s talk about something else.” Q. Re: Not my dogs: This is when you view your husband as you would a child having a tantrum. Cheerfully, matter-of-factly validate and hold the boundary: “I know it’s a lot of work, which is why I told you I wouldn’t take the dogs after spring. If you’re finding it too much of a burden, then tell your daughter.” Don’t use a judgmental tone; just keep a cheerful, matter-of-fact manner no matter what he says. A: Lovely. (It probably won’t work to view your partner as a child in most arguments, but in this instance, I think the approach is sound.) Q. Boyfriend secretly allows female overnight guest: While I was out of town, my boyfriend let a female friend sleep over on the couch in our apartment and purposely didn’t tell me. I found out, and his excuse was that he knew I would be upset if I had known. I know that nothing happened, but I think it’s very inappropriate to have a female overnight guest in our apartment, especially because they have slept together in the past. He also messaged her weeks later to say that he had been tempted to make a move on her. It’s also important to note that prior to my leaving town, we discussed that it would not be a good idea for him to even hang out with her (in a group setting with mutual friends), since I know about the past they’ve shared, and he’s lied about her before. Not only did he hang out with her, but then she slept over. I feel completely betrayed. Do I have a right to be? Advertisement A: Yes. I’m not necessarily on board with the “no female overnight guests in the apartment” policy as a general rule, but then again, I’m not in a relationship with you. It’s perfectly reasonable to ask your boyfriend not to host a former lover on your couch while you’re out of town, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be hurt and angry now that he did it and lied to you about it just to avoid a fight (and not for the first time). You two get to have a fight now, about boundaries and honesty and what expectations seem reasonable to you both and whether or not there is any trust left in this relationship. I suspect there’s been a breakdown on both sides, because something tells me your boyfriend did not show you this message he sent his friend. However, you found out, and you can’t unknow what you know now, which is that your boyfriend is sending at least preliminary signs of interest in cheating on you to other women. Decide whether or not you consider this relationship salvageable, and act accordingly. Q. Toying with time: When is it appropriate to introduce sex toys? I’m a bisexual woman in my 20s with a long-term health issue, for which I am prescribed a combination of medications that make it difficult to orgasm. For being alive, this is a trade-off I’m willing to make. Recently, my specialist and I adjusted my medication, and I have improved! I’m now able to orgasm, but only with the help of a vibrator. My question is: When is it appropriate to introduce a toy into the bedroom? I enjoy dating but can’t figure out the balance of when it’s appropriate to bring in toys with a new partner. I don’t want men to feel weirded out, but at the same time, I want to come too! (Lady-type partners take it in stride, so I have no problems there.) A: It is appropriate to introduce sex toys the first time you have sex with a new partner, if that’s what works for you. If you tell potential partners that, due to your health issues, you can only orgasm with a vibrator, and their response is anything less than a full-throated, “Then bring on the vibrators!” they are not likely to be good sexual matches for you, and you should gently release them back into the sea. Q. Have I given him too much time?: I’ve been officially dating my boyfriend for a little over a year, but we had an on again–off again relationship that was more physical for a year before that. This past year has been good, but we still haven’t exchanged “I love yous.” Nor have we really ever discussed the future. I told him in January that this was beginning to be a huge problem for me, and he did a good job of being more supportive, kind, and aware of his actions. But he still hasn’t said the L-word. Am I being foolish to stay with him when neither of us can find the courage to discuss the future and how we feel? Top Comment My teen years were not that exciting either. I think I'll rob a liquor store this evening to make up for it. More... Join In A: Some people aren’t especially invested in hearing the words I love you as long as their partners express affection and care in other ways; others could have the kindest, most devoted and loving partner alive and still need to hear them say it out loud. If it’s a problem for you, it doesn’t matter how kind he is otherwise. You’re not foolish for staying with this guy, but you know the conversation you need to have with him. If you love him (and I don’t think you’d be writing to me if you didn’t), then tell him so, since it sounds like you also have yet to say, “I love you.” If you want to discuss the future with him, then begin by acknowledging your own fears—that you’re worried you two don’t want the same things, that you’ll have to break up at the end of it, or that this conversation is somehow less worth having if you initiate it rather than him. Think about what you want, and tell him what that is, without apology or demand. You’re simply gathering information to see if the two of you are compatible in the long term, not trying to interrogate him. If he’s not able to articulate any sort of vision of the future for himself or any coherent sense of his feelings for you, then you likely have your answer. If, on the other hand, you two are able to find some common ground, then you might find once you’ve mustered the courage to have that first difficult conversation about feelings, future conversations about them will come all the easier.

      "text" : "The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, gets in the most trouble when he follows his boss’s thinking most closely.CreditPHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREW HARNIK / AP “Let’s start with yesterday—the Holocaust situation,” Greta Van Susteren said to Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, who always seems to be in one situation or another, on Wednesday, at a forum at Washington’s Newseum. There was, from the audience, a faint sound of stilted laughter, of the sort conveying not pleasure but a sense of the absurd. Spicer had already apologized, on CNN, for comments he made the day before, favorably comparing Adolf Hitler to Bashar al-Assad, through the nexus of chemical weapons, and so the main interest was in seeing how abjectly he would do so this time—and what else he might get wrong. First, the apology: “I made a mistake. There’s no other way to say it. I got into a topic I shouldn’t have, and I screwed up.” Spicer reminded the audience that he had “sought people’s forgiveness,” that it was extra painful “to know when you screwed up that you possibly offended a lot of people,” and that he was extra, extra sorry that it had happened this week “of all weeks.” He seemed to be referring to the week of both Passover and Easter (“It is a very solemn time for so many folks”), but, really, every week of the Trump Administration has been something to behold. As Spicer saw it, though, it had been an “unbelievable, successful couple of weeks” for President Donald Trump, until he, Spicer, interrupted that parade of triumphs with his personal squall. And yet Spicer gets in the most trouble when he follows his boss’s thinking most closely—and things just get worse when he tries to pull in history, or facts, to justify the route that Trump has taken him on. The “Holocaust situation” is an example of that. It began with Spicer explaining that the President had bombed Syria, upending his previous stance, because he was so moved by the pictures of the victims of a chemical attack. Faced with the predictable follow-ups from reporters—hadn’t there been plenty of horrific pictures from Syria before? would this also mean a change in refugee policy?—Spicer began to flounder. On refugees: “Well, I think you’ve heard a lot of these refugees in particular talk about the fact they’re not looking to flee.” (Perhaps in the sense that they wish there weren’t a war—but there is.) Also on refugees: “The goal isn’t to figure out how many people we can just import to this country.” Indeed, before Spicer began comparing Assad to Hitler, it sounded as if he might be coming dangerously close to comparing footage of sarin-gas-attack victims to the cell-phone video, at which he had earlier expressed horror, of a passenger being removed from a United flight. “Going back, I don’t mean to make two examples of this, but I don’t think you can watch those things. Not that you should have—any human being—but when you see, in particular, young children and babies being gassed, it should move any human being that has a heart.” Then someone asked why Spicer thought any of that would lead Vladimir Putin to abandon Syria, Russia’s longtime ally, and that’s when Spicer’s difficulties really escalated. Looking for clarity, he turned to Hitler. “You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons,” Spicer said. “So you have to, if you’re Russia, ask yourself, is this a country that you and a regime that you want to align yourself with?” There was an instant reaction in the outside world and on Twitter—Hitler, shy about using chemicals to kill people? What about Zyklon B?—but, inside the briefing room, things hummed on for a few minutes, with Spicer blithely embracing a question about whether Ivanka Trump had, as her brother Eric told the Telegraph, influenced her father’s decision to launch an air strike. There was “no question” that she had weighed in, Spicer said, but she wasn’t the only one: “Frankly, I don’t think that there’s many humans that came into contact with the President during that window of time that said”—that is, didn’t say—“ ‘did you see those images on television?’ ” (That answer gives its own odd picture of policy briefings as TV recaps.) Then Cecilia Vega, of ABC, raised her hand and, in what really was an act of generosity toward Spicer, said that she wanted to give him “an opportunity to clarify” his Hitler comment, which seemed “to be gaining some traction.” Perhaps it is best to read the resulting exchange in full: SPICER: I think when you come to sarin gas, there was no—he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing. I mean, there was clearly— I understand your point, thank you. VEGA: I’m just getting— SPICER: Thank you, I appreciate that. There was not—he brought them into the Holocaust center, I understand that. But I’m saying in the way that Assad used them, where he went into towns, dropped them down to innocent—into the middle of towns. It was brought—so the use of it—I appreciate the clarification there. That was not the intent. Two phrases stand out amid the storm of illogic: “he brought them into the Holocaust center,” which makes Auschwitz sound like a visitors’ kiosk at a museum, especially given the apparent attempt to contrast concentration camps with the middles of towns, as if discretion gained you points; and, more damningly, “his own people.” Hitler was the leader of Germany; by a conservative count, a hundred and sixty thousand of the Jews he killed were Germans. Not calling them Germans, excluding them from the circle of the people, was where it all began: it is the Holocaust’s center. Spicer’s apology, as heartfelt as it may be, doesn’t entirely resolve the issue. He is enmeshed in an Administration in which designations of us and them, our people and not our people, the good ones and the bad ones, provide a rubric for almost every policy. For Spicer to revert, as a default, to such terms in explaining why Assad is worse than Hitler suggests that he—and, it is a safe guess, others in the White House—are either not registering the implications of what their boss is saying or are doing so all too well. That is not to dismiss the simplest lesson of this incident: President Trump has given an important job to a person not competent to carry it out. This is not a problem confined to Spicer; Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, has also been entrusted with crucial tasks far beyond his experience. They are all playing with fire. Then again, in the Trump Administration, what would competent communications looks like? How do you persuasively promote the travel bans, or Ivanka’s role in matters of war, or explain away the Trump children’s financial conflicts? Just removing Spicer, or even Steve Bannon, or a dozen other aides, will not turn this White House into a sensible place. Yet Spicer, because he has the task of conveying messages to the wider world, is able, on his own, each day, to increase the possibility of mishaps with consequences. At the Newseum, a couple of minutes after his apology, Van Susteren asked him about North Korea. Trump had been tweeting belligerently, and the South Korean government had had to reassure its citizens that war wasn’t imminent. Spicer made a serious face. “We have a shared interest with China of making sure that we don’t have a nuclear North Korea,” he said. “We do have a nuclear North Korea,” Van Susteren interrupted. “No . . .” “I mean, we do,” Van Susteren said, and began reeling off facts about that nation’s arsenal. “They have, they have short- and medium-term miss—again, I’m not going to get into their nuclear capability,” Spicer said. Wasn’t that just what he’d done? What had he said, this time, and who was listening to him, and to his President?",

      "text" : "Any expectation that Scott Pruitt, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, would be able to cruise through an appearance on “Fox News Sunday” over the weekend was dashed within about 10 seconds of the interview. “Good morning, Chris, how are you?” Pruitt asked host Chris Wallace. That would be the softest question raised in the entire segment. “Good,” Wallace replied quickly. And then, in the same breath, Wallace began grilling Pruitt about an executive order President Trump signed last week to dismantle President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, which had required states to cut down on overall emissions and sought to limit carbon emissions from power plants. Wallace noted that the EPA, under Obama's administration, had set a number of health milestones attainable by 2030 — if the Clean Power Plan were implemented. Those included 90,000 fewer asthma attacks, 300,000 fewer missed work and school days, and 3,600 fewer premature deaths per year. “Without the Clear Power Plan, how are you going to prevent those terrible things?” Wallace asked Pruitt. Pruitt argued that Trump was “keeping a promise to the American people to roll back regulatory overreach.” He also noted that the Clean Power Plan was subject to a stay by the Supreme Court; he did not mention that he, as former Oklahoma attorney general, was one of several Republicans who had originally filed the lawsuit against Obama's regulations. Pruitt talks about the future of the EPA at CPAC Embed Copy Share Play Video3:19 Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 25 in Oxon Hill, Md. (The Washington Post) Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 25 in Oxon Hill, Md. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 25 in Oxon Hill, Md. (The Washington Post) “The president's keeping his promise to deal with that overreach, Chris,” Pruitt said. “It doesn't mean that clean air and clear water is not going to be the focus in the future. We're just going to do it right within the consistency of the framework that Congress has passed.” Wallace was not having it. “But sir, you're giving me a regulatory answer, a political answer,” Wallace said. “You're not giving a health answer.” [Scott Pruitt, longtime adversary of EPA, confirmed to lead the agency] The “Fox News Sunday” host repeated the statistics he had cited earlier, adding that half of all Americans live in counties with unhealthy air, according to the American Lung Association. “You're talking about regulatory overreach,” Wallace pressed. “But the question is, there are 166 million people living in unclean air, and you're going to remove some of the pollution restrictions, which would make the air even worse.” Pruitt did not address that question directly, instead asserting that the country's air quality was not as bad as it had been in the past, and that the United States was now “actually pre-1994 levels with respect to our CO2 footprint.” The back and forth continued. Pruitt's performance on the Sunday show earned the rare distinction of being panned by both climate change advocates and skeptics alike. “New EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt embarrassed himself repeatedly on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace, who kept Pruitt on the hot seat for 14 minutes as he pressed to get past Pruitt’s paper-thin talking points,” Jeremy Symons of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund wrote for the Huffington Post. Trump slashes federal climate protections Embed Copy Share Play Video2:39 President Trump signed an executive order on March 28, to obliterate former president Barack Obama's environmental record. The order will instruct federal regulators to rewrite Clean Power Plan rules that curb U.S. carbon emissions, as well as halt other environmental regulations. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) President Trump signed an executive order on March 28, to obliterate former president Barack Obama's environmental record. The order will instruct federal regulators to rewrite Clean Power Plan rules that curb U.S. carbon emissions, as well as halt other environmental regulations. President Trump will sign an executive order on March 28 to wipe away former president Barack Obama's environmental record. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Symons went on to fact-check Pruitt's statistics, noting that while the CO2 reductions he cited were accurate, they mostly occurred during the Obama administration as a result of the former president's clean-energy plans. “It's one thing to dodge the question, but it's especially weak to hide behind the success of Obama's initiative to justify erasing it all,” Symons wrote. “Pruitt’s attempting a complicated trick here — not only trying to sell a bottle of snake oil, but breaking the bottle during the pitch.” Pruitt received an equally dismal review on Breitbart, which called Trump's new EPA chief out for having “sweated, stuttered, and floundered” through what ultimately was “an entirely needless concession to the enemy.” “I just watched Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, get eaten alive by Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace,” columnist James Delingpole penned on the right-wing site. “Not only was it an ugly and painful sight but it was also a very dispiriting one.” Delingpole's argument, however, was that Pruitt did a disservice by not being more assured in defending climate-change skeptics. “Not only should he have known the most effective answers to give; but he should have been so confident in the rightness and truth of his cause that he should have been able to seize the moment and make the points that really need to be made about President Trump’s environmental policy,” Delingpole wrote. He added that the policy “is being enacted for the good of science, for the good of the economy and the core mission of Making America Great Again.” [EPA chief’s climate change denial is easily refuted by the EPA’s website] At one point, Wallace replayed a March 9 clip of an interview Pruitt gave on CNBC, in which Pruitt denied carbon dioxide was a primary contributor to global warming. Wallace then pulled up on the Fox News screen a number of reports that contradicted Pruitt, including one from the United Nations panel on climate change that said it is 95 percent likely that more than half the temperature increase since the mid-20th century is due to human activities. Another from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said there is more carbon dioxide now than in the last 400,000 years, and that 2015 and 2016 are the two hottest years in record. “Mr. Pruitt, are we supposed to believe that that's all a coincidence?” Wallace asked. Pruitt acknowledged that “there's a warming trend, that climate is changing and human activity contributes to that change in some measure,” before pivoting to another regulatory response. politics the-fix Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false 5-Minute Fix newsletter Keeping up with politics is easy now.

What if in fact the earth is warming? Simple question. What if you're wrong?” Pruitt has been a controversial choice to head the EPA since he was nominated by Trump last December. The two share a view that Obama's restrictions on the fossil-fuel industry were an unnecessary burden on business growth. Hundreds of former and current EPA employees protested Pruitt's nomination, urging the Senate to reject his confirmation in February. “Our perspective is not partisan,” the group wrote in a letter signed by 447 people. “However, every EPA administrator has a fundamental obligation to act in the public’s interest based on current law and the best available science.

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chaffetz-no-indication-flynn-complied-with-legal-requirements-on-overseas-payments-1493134172WASHINGTON—Leaders of the House Oversight Committee said former national security adviser Mike Flynn violated the law by failing to obtain required permission from the Army and State Department before receiving money from entities associated with the Russian and Turkish governments.Mr. Flynn also failed to disclose payments from a Russian state television network when he renewed his security clearance last year, as was required, one of the committee leaders said.The panel’s Republican chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, and Democratic ranking member, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said they are asking the Defense Department to determine whether Mr. Flynn, a former three-star Army general and head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency, must return payments he received after leaving the military for work linked to foreign governments. Capital Journal is WSJ.com’s home for politics, policy and national security news.“I see no information or no data to support the notion that Gen. Flynn complied with the law,” said Mr. Chaffetz in a joint news conference with his Democratic counterpart at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, after viewing classified documents provided by the Defense Department. The documents were given to the committee as part of its investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Flynn’s departure from President Donald Trump’s administration.“Gen. Flynn had a duty and an obligation to seek and obtain permission to receive money from foreign governments prior to any engagement with them,” he said. “It does not appear to us that that was ever sought, nor did he ever get that permission.”Further, Mr. Cummings said, Mr. Flynn didn’t disclose payments from the state-owned Russian television network RT on his 2016 application for renewal of his security clearance. Such applications typically ask about foreign sources of income and contact with foreign-government officials.“There is no evidence anywhere in these documents that he reported the funds he received for his trip,” Mr. Cummings said. The application for a security clearance was submitted before he became a lobbyist for a nonprofit later linked to Turkey, but experts say he would have been obligated to report that income before joining government.Robert Kelner, an attorney for Mr. Flynn, disputed the committee’s characterization of the payments.“Gen. Flynn briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency, a component agency of DoD, extensively regarding the RT speaking-event trip both before and after the trip, and he answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip during those briefings,” Mr. Kelner said.Under U.S. law, approval for a retired Army officer to receive foreign-government payments must come from the secretary of the Army and secretary of state.A Defense Department white paper instructs retired Army personnel to obtain approval from U.S. Army Human Resources Command, which is separate from the DIA. The Army previously said in a letter to Mr. Cummings that it had found no record of Mr. Flynn reporting his Russian pay to the military service.In one case, Mr. Flynn was paid more than $30,000 by state-sponsored RT for a Moscow speech in 2015. He also later registered as a lobbyist for Turkey, acknowledging that some of his work for a nonprofit could be seen as benefiting the Ankara-based government. Both took place before his brief stint in the Trump administration.Under the Pentagon’s guidelines, retired military officers failing to report foreign pay can be penalized through withholding of their retirement disbursements equal to the amount of the pay received.“There are repercussions for the violation of law,” Mr. Chaffetz said.Mr. Flynn left the Trump administration in February after it was revealed that he misled top White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his contact with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition.Congress is also probing Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into any ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and foreign agents. Russia denies any involvement in the election.While the bulk of the investigation into Russian interference is being handled by the House and Senate intelligence committees, the Oversight Committee, headed by Mr. Chaffetz, has been looking into the situation around Mr. Flynn as part of its mandate to investigate government waste, fraud and abuse.The panel asked the White House last month for information related to Mr. Flynn’s tenure in the Trump administration and his foreign contacts.In a response, the White House said it was “unable to accommodate” requests concerning Mr. Flynn’s contacts with foreign governments, citing their classified nature. The Oversight Committee is authorized to review classified information. The White House elaborated on that response Tuesday.“All the information that they’re talking about occurred prior to him being in the White House,” press secretary Sean Spicer said, insisting that issues under scrutiny related to Mr. Flynn’s work as a private citizen, not as a member of the administration. “To ask the White House to produce documents that were not in the possession of the White House is ridiculous.”—Paul Sonne contributed to this article.

      "text" : "The many ups and downs of the GOP health-care battle Embed Copy Share Play Video3:56 Republicans withdrew the American Health Care Act moments before a scheduled vote on March 24, after failing to woo enough lawmakers to support it. Here are the key turning points in their fight to pass the bill. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Republicans withdrew the American Health Care Act moments before a scheduled vote on March 24, after failing to woo enough lawmakers to support it. Here are the key turning points in their fight to pass the bill. Here are the key turning points in the Republicans' fight to pass the American Health Care Act. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Why were Republicans rushing to vote on a health-care plan that they'd barely finished drafting, that budget scorekeepers hadn't had a chance to fully evaluate, and that, insofar as people did know about it, was widely despised? In part, it's because their plan was so unpopular and because it got more unpopular the more people learned about it. But it's also because only by rushing to reshape a full sixth of the American economy without knowing exactly how they would be reshaping it would Republicans be able to use health care to pave the way for the rest of their agenda, including tax reform. In other words, the GOP didn't want to let a detail like tens of millions of people losing their health insurance get in the way of two tax cuts for the rich. Here's what we knew about the Republican plan. The latest version that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had a chance to analyze would have, over the course of 10 years, cut taxes by $1 trillion, disproportionately benefiting the rich; cut Medicaid spending by $839 billion, exclusively harming the poor and sick; and cut the Affordable Care Act's health insurance subsidies by about $300 billion, mostly hurting older people of modest means. Add it all up, and the CBO estimated that 24 million people would have lost their health insurance as a result. Not only that, but premiums would have increased 15 percent to 20 percent more than they otherwise would have in the next four years before so many older people were priced out of the market that premiums would have started to come down, and deductibles, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, would have been an average of $1,550 higher. In short: The GOP would have made insurance more affordable for younger people by making it unaffordable for older people and worse for everyone. This wasn't just a matter of higher premiums and higher deductibles, though. Trumpcare also would have repealed the “essential health benefits” that plans are required to cover now. States would have been allowed to write their own rules, so, depending on where you lived, insurance companies might have been able to sell you “insurance” that didn't cover hospitalizations, prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health care and preventive care, and also imposed annual and lifetime limits on your benefits. People who couldn't afford insurance that actually, you know, insured them might have bought these skimpy plans with their skimpy tax credits — why not use them on a fake something instead of a real nothing? — but neither the CBO nor they themselves likely would have thought of this as being covered. The surprising thing, then, isn't that as few as 17 percent of people approved of the American Health Care Act. It's that as many as 17 percent did. But there's a reason the GOP was pushing a bill that would have taken everything people don't like about the health-care system and made it worse. That's the fact that it would have allowed them to pass two permanent tax cuts for the rich. Anyone, you see, can pass a tax cut that expires after 10 years. But if you want to make it last — and you don't have 60 votes in the Senate — then you need to find a way to pay for it (or at least look like you did). Taking health insurance away from poor and sick people would have done just that for the Obamacare taxes, which primarily hit people in the top 1 or 2 percent. Indeed, as you can see below in the chart from the Urban Institute, the combination of tax cuts for the rich and benefit cuts for the poor that was the GOP health-care plan would have been a reverse Robin Hood that redistributed income from people making $50,000 or less to mostly those making $200,000 or more. business wonkblog true Wonkbook newsletter Your daily policy cheat sheet from Wonkblog. Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Now, the crazy thing is that this first tax cut for the rich (in the form of Obamacare “repeal and replace”) would have made a second one (this one coming in the form of “tax reform”) look more affordable. That's because, due to parliamentary rules, tax revisions can't lose any revenue outside the 10-year budget window if it's going to be permanent. The question, though, is lose revenue compared to what. If Republicans had repealed the Affordable Care Act's $1 trillion worth of taxes before they revised taxes, that's $1 trillion less they'd have to come up with to make it look like money wasn't being lost. Now, without those phantom savings, tax restructuring, Speaker of the House Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) admitted, will be “more difficult.” Not that it was ever going to be easy. After all, the $1 trillion they were trying to save with a “border adjustment tax” seems to be on political life support, since every major retailer, including big GOP donors such as Walmart, is opposed to it. And, as you might have guessed, there aren't an extra $2 trillion of savings lying around for them to replace the ones they thought they were going to get from this and repealing the Affordable Care Act. Which is to say that Republicans will either have to scale back their ambitions for how deeply they will cut taxes or how long they will. Whatever they choose, though, the top tax rate isn't going to stay under 30 percent. And for the GOP, that's the real tragedy of 24 million people keeping their health insurance.",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — President Trump ignites a lot of fights, but his failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the biggest defeat in his short time in the White House, was the result of something else: a long-running Republican civil war that humbled a generation of party leaders before he ever came to Washington.A precedent-flouting president who believes that Washington’s usual rules do not apply to him, Mr. Trump now finds himself shackled by them.In stopping the repeal of President Barack Obama’s proudest legacy — the Republican Party’s professed priority for the last seven years — from even coming to a vote, the rebellious far right wing out-rebelled Mr. Trump, taking on and defeating the party establishment with which it has long been at war and which he now leads.Like every one else who has tried to rule a fissured and fractious party, Mr. Trump now faces a wrenching choice: retrenchment or realignment.Does he cede power to the anti-establishment wing of his party? Or does he seek other pathways to successful governing by throwing away the partisan playbook and courting a coalition with the Democrats, whom he has improbably blamed for his party’s shortcomings?“It’s really a problem in our own party, and that’s something he’ll need to deal with moving forward,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, an ally of the center-right Tuesday Group, which stuck with Mr. Trump in the health care fight and earned the president’s praise in the hours after the bill’s defeat.“I think he did a lot — he met with dozens and dozens of members and made a lot of accommodations — but in the end, there’s a group of people in this party who just won’t say yes,” Mr. Cole said. “At some point, I think that means looking beyond our conference. The president is a deal maker, and Ronald Reagan cut some of his most important deals with Democrats.”Mr. Trump is not there yet. Before becoming a presidential candidate, he seemed to have little fixed ideology. But as president, he has operated from the standard-issue Republican playbook, embracing many of the positions of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the party establishment. While he is angry and thirsty for revenge, he seems determined to swallow the loss in hopes of marshaling enough Republican support to pass spending bills, an as-yet unformed tax overhaul and a $1 trillion infrastructure package — legislation that could attract considerable Democratic support but has the potential to split the party.On Friday evening, a somewhat shellshocked president retreated to the White House residence to grieve and assign blame. In a search for scapegoats, he asked his advisers repeatedly: Whose fault was this?Increasingly, that blame has fallen on Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, who coordinated initial legislative strategy on the health care bill with Mr. Ryan, his close friend and a fellow Wisconsinite, according to three people briefed on the president’s recent discussions.Despite the public displays of unity with the speaker, Mr. Trump and his team now regret outsourcing so much of the early drafting to Mr. Ryan. One aide compared doing that to a developer’s staking everything on obtaining a property without conducting a thorough inspection. And they were stunned by his inability to master the politics of his own conference.Mr. Trump, an image-obsessed developer with a lifelong indifference toward the mechanics of governance, made a game effort to negotiate with members of the far-right Freedom Caucus, even if it seemed to some members of that group, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, that he did not have the greatest grasp of health care policy or legislative procedure.He told one adviser late Friday that his loss — a legislative debacle foreshadowed by the intraparty fight that led to the 2013 government shutdown — was a minor bump in the road and that the White House would recover.In an interview with The New York Times on Friday, Mr. Trump asserted that the administration was “rocking.” The problem, he suggested, was divisions among Republicans.There are “a lot of players, a lot of players with a very different mind-set,” Mr. Trump said. “You have liberals, even within the Republican Party. You have the conservative players.”But his advisers were more realistic. Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, according to people familiar with White House discussions, described the president’s decision to withdraw the health care bill in the face of its almost-certain defeat as a flat-out failure that could inflict serious damage on this presidency — even if Mr. Bannon believes Congress, not Mr. Trump, deserves much of the blame.Mr. Bannon and the president’s more soft-spoken legislative affairs director, Marc Short, pushed Mr. Trump hard to insist on a public vote, as a way to identify, shame and pressure “no” voters who were killing their best chance to unravel the health care law.One Republican congressional aide who was involved in the last-minute negotiations said Mr. Bannon and Mr. Short were seeking to compile an enemies list. Mr. Ryan repeatedly counseled the president to avoid seeking vengeance — at least until he has passed spending bills and a debt-ceiling increase needed to keep the government running. In the end, the president decided to back down.But Mr. Trump’s advisers worry about the hard reality — the developer with the tough-guy veneer was steamrollered by factions in the Republican Congress.As the dust settled on the health care debacle, it was clear that Mr. Trump’s lieutenants in the Republican civil war had been divided on how they thought the health care fight should have been handled, which does not augur well for the political battles to come.Mutual disgust with the Freedom Caucus seems to be pulling Mr. Ryan and, despite his misgivings, Mr. Trump, together, at least for now — just as it briefly united President Barack Obama and John A. Boehner, Mr. Ryan’s long-suffering predecessor, during their doomed effort to reach a “grand bargain” on a tax overhaul in 2011.Until the very end, Mr. Trump’s team was deeply divided over whether he should fully commit to a hard sell on a bill they viewed as fundamentally flawed, with Vice President Mike Pence pointedly advising the president to label the effort “Ryancare,” not “Trumpcare,” according to aides. A Pence spokesman denied that the vice president tried to tie the bill to the speaker.Many on Mr. Trump’s team disengaged from the process even as he dug in. Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, had originally been tasked with playing a large role in shepherding the legislation from the White House side. But Mr. Cohn had grown leery of the bill, and the White House recognized that Mr. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs and a Democrat, was not a good messenger to deal with recalcitrant conservatives.Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a key adviser, had said for weeks that he thought supporting the bill was a mistake, according to two people who spoke with him. But he was on a family skiing trip in Aspen, Colo., last week, and did not return to Washington until Friday — much to the annoyance of Mr. Trump, who thought he should have been in Washington in the whole week, according to two Republicans close to the White House.But Mr. Trump brushed aside those concerns in the last few days and embraced the conventional role as leader of his party. He has one speed when he decides to shift to sales mode, aides said, and he had trouble modulating his tone, issuing cringe-inducing superlatives like “wonderful” to describe an ungainly bill his aides described as anything but.After it was all over, the president dutifully blamed the Democrats, a party out of power and largely leaderless, after turning his back on their offers to negotiate on a bipartisan package that would have addressed shortcomings in the Affordable Care Act while preserving its core protections for poor and working-class patients.Aides advised him the argument was nonsensical, according to a person with knowledge of the interaction.For Mr. Trump’s Republican opponents, here was revenge served cold. As a candidate in 2016, he initially scoffed at signing a Republican loyalty pledge, at times behaving more like an independent invading the Republican host organism than like a typical presidential candidate.As president, Mr. Trump has left dozens of critical administration jobs unfilled, rejecting stalwart Republican applicants deemed insufficiently loyal to him — and now he is decrying the disloyalty of the 20 to 30 conservative members who outmaneuvered and overpowered him on health care.“We all learned a lot — we learned a lot about loyalty,” a solemn Mr. Trump told reporters late Friday.The dynamic that led to his defeat is bigger than Mr. Trump, despite his tendency to personalize every win or loss. Republicans who gained power by savaging Washington are in full control and cannot agree on a path forward.“We were a 10-year opposition party,” Mr. Ryan said in assessing the defeat late Friday. “Being against things was easy to do.”Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, said after the health bill was pulled that he was “getting some déjà vu right now.”“Do you think Donald J. Trump goes home tonight, shrugs and says, ‘This is what winning looks like’?” Mr. Gingrich added. “No! But this is where the Republican Party is right now, and it’s been this way for years.”But Mr. Trump put on his best face on Saturday morning. “ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE,” he said on Twitter. “Do not worry!”",

      "text" : "Donald F. McGahn II, now President Trump’s White House counsel, made $2.4 million as a lawyer with a client list loaded with deep-pocketed conservative groups, from Americans for Prosperity, backed by the conservative billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch, to the Citizens United Foundation.Mr. Trump’s legislative affairs director, Marc Short, earned $78,000 from Freedom Partners, a Koch-linked group where he once served as president, plus nearly $380,000 for consulting work, listing clients such as the Club for Growth and Susan B. Anthony List, both right-leaning activist groups, as well as the presidential campaign of Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.And Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, reported earning more than $1 million in income tied to conservative-oriented work, with at least $500,000 of that from entities linked to the conservative megadonor Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, including the Breitbart News Network and Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm partly owned by Mr. Mercer that worked for the Trump campaign.Those disclosures, contained in 92 personal financial statements of Trump administration staff members released starting Friday night, offer a hint of how an explosion in spending has expanded the lucrative array of private political work in Washington, enriching even the anti-establishment activists and operatives who sided with Mr. Trump.Much of the new business has come through “super PACs” and political nonprofit groups whose fund-raising has soared since the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010. While such groups were once a modest sideline to campaign and lobbying work, the new campaign spending rules have allowed wealthy donors and their entourages to displace campaign managers and party leaders as the leading political power center.More such business has come from private foundations and ideologically oriented media companies linked to donors like the Mercers, who have invested in websites, documentaries and other endeavors to battle traditional news organizations. They have also formed political advisory operations to steer their giving and promote their influence.The figures reveal the extent to which private political work has bolstered the financial fortunes of Trump aides, who have made millions of dollars from Republican and other conservative causes in recent years, according to an analysis of the disclosure forms by The New York Times after they were transformed into a computerized database by the Center for Public Integrity.“It has been a bonanza for the consulting class,” said Walter Shapiro, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, where he studies political spending and campaign finance. “And in this era of dark money, people have gotten very, very rich.”To be sure, Democrats take care of their own, as well. When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, his senior adviser, David Axelrod, reported an income of more than $1 million, listing consulting services for Democratic candidates and other political clients. Others, like Robert Gibbs, the press secretary, reported income from working on the Obama campaign.For the Trump aides, one potential drawback is that they will now take government salaries, which for many will amount to a cut in pay as they refrain from outside work to avoid conflicts. When their time in the administration ends, however, they could find even more riches waiting for them.The arrangement has been especially lucrative for insiders and key operatives with links to the biggest donors, and those closest to Mr. Trump, despite his campaigning on an anti-establishment message and his disparagement of business as usual in Washington.The White House did not respond to a request for comment from the aides included in this article.The list of income sources for those in Mr. Trump’s White House reads like an encyclopedia of conservative wealth and influence. Many of Mr. Trump’s aides have earned money from right-leaning media organizations like Breitbart and Fox News, or from a firm set up by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, to manage his speaking and television appearances. Several aides received payments from organizations backed by major conservative benefactors such as the Kochs or the Mercers. Others were paid for work on Republican campaigns, including Mr. Trump’s or that of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a onetime rival.Few Trump advisers are as plugged into the old and new worlds of political money as Kellyanne Conway, counselor to Mr. Trump. As a Republican strategist and pollster who ran a consulting firm, Ms. Conway earned more than $800,000 from her firm and reported 75 sources of income.Among the clients that paid her at least $5,000 were the Tea Party Patriots, a group founded in 2009 to oppose Mr. Obama’s health care and spending initiatives, and the Judicial Crisis Network, a nonprofit group that has spent millions of dollars, raised from wealthy donors, in an effort to reshape the federal court system.She advised nearly a dozen candidates on their campaigns, including Mr. Trump and Mike Pence, now the vice president. Ms. Conway also earned money from speaking appearances at conservative think tanks like the Alabama Policy Institute and the John Locke Foundation.Like many of her colleagues, Ms. Conway also profited from at least two Mercer endeavors: A super PAC called Keep the Promise, and Cambridge Analytica, which claims to provide “psychographic” profiles that can predict the political leanings of each American adult.By contrast, Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, who toiled in the party machinery as chairman of the Republican National Committee, reported a more conventional, if still lucrative, financial picture. In addition to earning $396,000 from his law firm, Mr. Priebus earned a salary last year of $225,000 from the committee and an additional $175,000 in bonuses. (The party did appear to offer Mr. Priebus at least one perk: rent payments totaling $57,000.)Stefan C. Passantino, a top White House ethics lawyer, disclosed 70 income sources for his legal services, including groups like the Texas Conservatives Fund, along with more traditional corporate clients like Delta Air Lines and Icahn Capital, the investment firm headed by the billionaire Trump adviser Carl Icahn.K. T. McFarland, an aide in three Republican White Houses who was appointed deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration, reported $64,000 from Fox News, where she served as a security analyst.And Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to the president, took in tens of thousands of dollars for his book “Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War,” as well as his work for Fox News and Breitbart.The Mercers are major investors in Breitbart News, and the filings provide a kind of map to the family’s sprawling influence in Mr. Trump’s White House.Those who have worked with the father-daughter donor powerhouse have described their charity as having a political bent: to fix what they see as the mistakes of the Obama presidency. That has meant providing funding to institutions, nonprofit organizations and businesses that promote small government, lower taxes and undoing the welfare state.Breitbart has functioned as a platform to spread a right-wing vision around the world. In addition to Cambridge Analytica, the Mercers have also spent millions on the Media Research Center, a conservative group that says its sole mission is “to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the left.”According to records, the Mercers’ foundation also donated at least $2 million to the Government Accountability Institute, an organization founded by Mr. Bannon and the writer and political consultant Peter Schweizer.With his own links to Breitbart and the Government Accountability Institute, as well as other ventures, Mr. Bannon has especially close ties to the Mercers. He reported a financial stake worth $1 million to $5 million in Cambridge Analytica, a stake he is now seeking to sell.Citizens United, a conservative group that was the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case of the same name, and is run by the political operative David Bossie, received $3.5 million from the Mercer Family Foundation between 2012 and 2014, according to the most recent public records. Mr. Bannon, Ms. Conway and Mr. McGahn all disclosed receiving pay from the group or its affiliates — in the case of Mr. Bannon, totaling $100,000.The disclosures also, for the first time, provide some visibility into how much Mr. Trump has been paying some of his most loyal employees, who have now moved with him to the White House.Jason Greenblatt, a lawyer at the family company who now serves as the White House special representative for international negotiations, was paid $1 million by the Trump Organization, the filing says. Keith Schiller, who now oversees Oval Office operations, reported income totaling $294,000 for his security work for the Trump Organization, the campaign and a separate security firm, which worked for the campaign, too.Fred Wertheimer, the founder of Democracy 21, a nonprofit group that advocates changes in campaign finance laws, said the large payouts were yet another reason that Congress needed to revamp laws to require greater disclosure of political fund-raising and spending.“This is an industry, a Washington industry, that is embedded into the political system, and the consultant class is making a fortune regardless of what views or candidates they represent,” Mr. Wertheimer said. “And it is a major factor in the cost of campaigns, and it is a group of people who are probably the biggest opponents of campaign finance reform in the system.”",

      "text" : "House leaders told GOP lawmakers Saturday that they plan to devote their energy this week to keeping the federal government open, conspicuously avoiding an immediate commitment to take up health care despite pledges to do so by conservatives and the White House. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), speaking on a conference call with GOP members, offered no specific plan on how or when lawmakers might see details of a new proposal to revise the Affordable Care Act, which White House officials promised would receive a vote by Wednesday. Ryan also made clear that his top priority was to pass a stopgap spending bill to keep government open past April 28, an objective that requires Democratic support. “Wherever we land will be a product the president can and will support.” Ryan said, according to a senior GOP aide on the call. The call comes as GOP leaders find themselves trapped between proving that they can complete basic tasks of governing such as funding the government, while also meeting the demands of President Trump, who is looking for a legislative win ahead of his 100th day in office next Saturday. Ryan’s comments suggested that he and other House Republicans have made the choice to focus on the former. He said, for instance, that the House will vote on a health-care bill when Republicans are sure they have the support to pass it, according to several GOP aides on the call — suggesting that he does not believe that to be the case currently, despite renewed negotiations between House conservatives, moderates and the White House. Ryan encouraged members to continue discussing ideas, but he did not open the call for questions, leaving members to wait until Wednesday morning before they can weigh in on spending or health care. Trump and his top aides have been calling on Congress to take dramatic action in the coming week: vote on health care, take up tax reform and demand that Democrats agree to a stopgap spending measure that includes funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. [@PKCapitol: History tells us that Republicans are taking on too much this week — and it isn’t likely to end well] Ryan attempted to calm the disorder Saturday by telling members that repealing the Affordable Care Act remains a priority but urging them to focus on the immediate task of the budget negotiations, according to the aides on the call. Ryan has vowed for weeks that there will be no government shutdown, and many Republicans and Democrats have said in recent days that negotiations are proceeding apace. At the same time, Trump has publicly downplayed the significance of achieving a victory in the coming week. He dismissed the symbolism of the 100-day mark — despite his repeated promises on the campaign trail that he would meet many of his goals by that date. He also began walking back the health-care promise after signs emerged that GOP leaders were not prepared to take it up because of the risk that it would anger Democrats. “We’ll see what happens,” Trump said on Friday. “No particular rush, but we’ll see what happens.” Then, on Saturday, Trump added to the confusion with a promise to release details of a tax overhaul next week. “Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday,” he tweeted. Less clear was what will come of Trump’s desire to include funding for a border wall in the stopgap measure. On Saturday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly suggested in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper scheduled to air Sunday morning that Trump may demand the funding. “I think it goes without saying that the president has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall,” Kelly said. “So I would suspect, he’ll do the right thing for sure, but I would suspect he will be insistent on the funding.” [‘Big announcement’ on tax reform unlikely to reveal details, White House official says] The comment is likely to further threaten bipartisan budget talks, which were jostled after Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, announced last week that the White House would demand border wall funding in the upcoming spending bill. Such a demand would almost certainly prompt Democrats, whose support is needed to pass the budget bill in the Senate, to vote no. Aides on the Hill and inside the White House, who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity, said they believe Trump sees a demand for wall money as the best way to prove that his most controversial proposals can be fulfilled. “This president should be allowed to have his highest priorities funded even though the Democrats rightly have a seat at the table because of the Senate rules,” Mulvaney said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Live. “You cannot expect a president who just won election to give up very easily on his highest priority.” powerpost false endOfArticle true Please provide a valid email address.

See all newsletters That demand came as a surprise to Democrats who have been working for more than a month with GOP leaders to craft a bipartisan spending bill that would keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year on September 30. The bipartisan talks were seen as a rare bright spot in an otherwise acrimonious, bitter relationship between Republicans and Democrats in Washington. One particular area of agreement was not to include border-protection funds in the stopgap budget, which, it was agreed, should be debated separately, after government is kept open. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said leaders in Congress could reach a spending agreement, but only the White House stays out of the negotiations. “I want to come up with an agreement,” Schumer said Tuesday on a conference call with reporters. “Our Republican colleagues know that since they control, you know, the House, the Senate and the White House, that a shutdown would fall on their shoulders, and they don’t want it.” Damian Paletta contributed to this report.

      "text" : "Democrat Daniel Helmer, an Army veteran and Rhodes Scholar emboldened by the election of President Trump, on Tuesday announced his campaign to challenge Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.). Helmer said he has raised $120,000 — an amount he hopes will set him apart from a crowded field of candidates that is shaping up ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. “This election evidences a loss of trust between our people and our government and a desire for new leadership and fresh perspectives,” he said Monday afternoon as his family’s cocker spaniel and English bull terrier padded around the patio of his Fairfax County home. “It’s important for America that we fix this.” As the closest thing to a swing district in the Washington metro area, the Northern Virginia district is experiencing a surge in liberal activism. Political newcomers are registering in large numbers to challenge GOP lawmakers in state House districts that went to Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. Helmer’s announcement came on the same day that three other military veterans kicked off campaigns to try to unseat Republican incumbents in California, Colorado and Pennsylvania. Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) celebrates her election victory in 2016. (J. Lawler Duggan/For The Washington Post) On Monday, a political action committee called Take Back the Tenth erected a billboard near Winchester urging Comstock to hold a town hall. Members of the Indivisible VA District 10 Facebook group are planning daily demonstrations outside Comstock’s Sterling district office this week while Congress is in recess. Each day they will focus on a different issue, such as climate change, immigration, health care and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Comstock is part of a House delegation spending the week in the Middle East and was celebrating Palm Sunday Mass with U.S. troops on the Sinai Peninsula at the time of the deadly bombings in Egypt, said her spokesman, Jeff Marschner. (The U.S. military organized the trip at taxpayers’ expense.) Comstock won a second term by six percentage points in November, despite independent analysts’ predictions that the race would be a squeaker. Nationally, Democrats and Republicans poured resources into the district, and outside groups spent about $15 million there. Democrats think they have a chance to unseat Comstock because Clinton won the district by double digits and, they say, Trump is unpopular with the affluent, diverse and highly educated population of Loudoun County, the heart of the district. Comstock, however, remains popular. She raised more than $500,000 in the first quarter of the year, according to her campaign. Complete reports are due Saturday. Helmer, 35, kicked off his campaign with a day-long tour of businesses throughout the district. He also planned to donate blood and knock on some doors. The sprawling district includes moderate suburbs outside the District and conservative strongholds near the West Virginia border. He lives in the Springfield section of Fairfax County. Echoing results across the congressional district, Clinton carried his voting precinct by six percentage points last year, but Comstock won it by 11 points. [ Trump budget would eliminate funding for Chesapeake Bay cleanup ] Like Comstock, Helmer denounced Trump’s freeze on federal hires and the sweeping cuts in his budget proposal. “This district is made up of many dedicated public servants who are seeing the potential to have their jobs undermined by what’s coming,” he said. A New Jersey native, Helmer moved to the district with his wife and two sons in December 2013, about the time the Army major was released from active duty. He serves in the reserves and works as a strategic adviser at the Boston Consulting Group, he said. The grandson of Holocaust survivors, Helmer graduated from the U.S. Military Academy and was deployed to Iraq in 2004. As the only Arabic speaker in his battalion, he served as an assistant intelligence officer before studying international relations at Oxford University on a Rhodes scholarship. In 2007, while stationed in Afghanistan, the commanding general summoned him to Kabul to give a presentation on counterinsurgency training, he said. His advice to bring Afghan and coalition leaders together to work on problems was implemented within six weeks, he said. local virginia-politics Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Local Headlines newsletter Daily headlines about the Washington region.

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-plans-to-impose-20-tariff-on-canadian-soft-lumber-imports-1493075372The Trump administration is taking retaliatory action against Canada over a decades-old trade dispute, moving to impose a 20% tariff on softwood lumber that is typically used to build single-family homes, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday in an interview.Mr. Ross said the tariff would be applied retroactively and imposed on Canadian exports to the U.S. of about $5 billion a year. He said the dispute centers on Canadian provinces that have been allegedly allowing loggers to cut trees down at improperly subsidized costs and sell them at lower prices.The decision is preliminary and the Commerce Department will need to make a final determination. After that, the U.S. International Trade Commission will also need to find that the U.S. industry has suffered injury before any tariff is levied. But even a preliminary decision has immediate real-world consequences, by discouraging importers from buying lumber from Canada.“We tried to negotiate a settlement but we were unable,” just as previous administrations were also unable to resolve the dispute with Canada, Mr. Ross said.He said the Trump administration has notified Canada of its decision. A spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, who is in charge of U.S.-Canada relations, wasn’t immediately available to comment. President Donald Trump’s heightened rhetoric over Canadian treatment of U.S. lumber and dairy producers in recent days marked a sharp pivot for the president on America’s northern neighbor and second-largest two-way trading partner, after China, with nearly $545 billion in goods and services crossing the border in 2016.In the lead-up to the decision on lumber duties, U.S.-Canada trade watchers said the Trump administration’s move on timber could serve as an opening gambit in laying out what he wants Canada to put on the table as part of the North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiations, which have yet to begin in earnest.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last week that when it comes to trade irritants, from lumber to dairy, he would “present the facts” to Washington and aim to work constructively on making improvements to Nafta.“We appreciate today’s actions by the Department of Commerce,” said Cameron Krauss, senior vice president of legal affairs at the U.S. Lumber Coalition, which represents large and small American producers.The trade row between the U.S. and Canada over lumber dates back decades, although the countries reached a standstill through a bilateral deal struck in 2006 that stopped the U.S. from imposing additional duties. Under that arrangement, which expired in late 2015, Canadian forest producers agreed to accept either a quota on U.S.-bound exports or pay a tax on goods shipped to the U.S. in exchange for no tariffs.The U.S. lumber industry filed a complaint last fall to the Commerce Department, alleging that Canadian lumber is unfairly dumped—or sold at less than market value—into the U.S. market and that Canada heavily subsidizes its timber industry by offering Pacific Coast producers access to wood from government-owned land at below-market prices.The prospect of U.S. duties on Canadian lumber imports has roiled prices so far this year. Lumber futures rose more than 25% in the early months of 2017, peaking at their highest point in over 12 years. The U.S. ran a trade deficit of $5.28 billion in 2016 with Canada on products from sawmills, which captures softwood lumber—or the product at the heart of the U.S.-Canadian dispute.The preliminary duties over alleged subsidies vary depending on the Canadian firm, according to a release from the U.S. Commerce Department late Monday. The tariffs range from 3% to 24% for companies named in the documents, with unspecified Canadian producers set to pay 20%.During the election campaign and the weeks following, Mr. Trump focused much of his trade ire against Mexico, China and Germany. When Mr. Trudeau visited the White House in February, the president spoke of the U.S.’s “outstanding” trade relationship with Canada and of how only some tweaking would be required to Nafta when it came to Canada.But pointed comments—in particular Mr. Trump’s dislike of how Canada restricts access to U.S. producers to its dairy market—and his move Mondayto slap a new tariff on Canadian lumber suggest the Nafta renegotiation could be more complicated than initially believed.The president “is using his skills as a negotiator to set the bar very high and highlight a problematic area for U.S.-Canada trade,” said Laura Dawson, director of the Canada Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank.Mr. Ross said the disputes illustrate the shortcomings of Nafta, which he said has restricted dairy products that Americans can export to Canada, yet allowed Canada to “dump lumber here.”“That is not a very satisfactory agreement,” he said.The issue is important for U.S. lawmakers in the Pacific Northwest, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees trade policy—and on the panel that has delayed a vote on Mr. Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. “Today’s announcement sends the message that help is on the way,” Mr. Wyden said in a statement Monday. “America needs continued tough trade enforcement and a durable solution to the Canadian policies that distort trade and hold American lumber businesses back.”The Canada dairy dispute has also caught the attention of powerful lawmakers in border states, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader.The Commerce Department handled subsidies and dumping cases in the Obama administration with little fanfare, but Mr. Ross has sought to raise the profile of these ordinary industry cases and also work toward filing rarely used unilateral cases against trading partners.—Will Mauldin and Benjamin Parkin in Chicago contributed to this article.

Mike Flynn, while serving as an adviser to the Trump campaign, met with top Turkish government ministers and discussed removing a Muslim cleric from the U.S. and taking him to Turkey, according to former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey, who attended, and others who were briefed on the meeting.The discussion late last summer involved ideas about how to get Fethullah Gulen, a cleric whom Turkey has accused of orchestrating last summer’s failed military coup, to Turkey without going through the U.S. extradition legal process, according to Mr. Woolsey and those who were briefed.Mr. Woolsey told The Wall Street Journal he arrived at the meeting in New York on Sept. 19 in the middle of the discussion and found the topic startling and the actions being discussed possibly illegal.The Turkish ministers were interested in open-ended thinking on the subject, and the ideas were raised hypothetically, said the people who were briefed. The ministers in attendance included the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the country’s foreign minister, foreign-lobbying disclosure documents show.Mr. Woolsey said the idea was “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away.” The discussion, he said, didn’t include actual tactics for removing Mr. Gulen from his U.S. home. If specific plans had been discussed, Mr. Woolsey said, he would have spoken up and questioned their legality.It isn’t known who raised the idea or what Mr. Flynn concluded about it. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Mr. Flynn, who was advising the Trump campaign on national security at the time of the meeting, disputed the account, saying “at no time did Gen. Flynn discuss any illegal actions, nonjudicial physical removal or any other such activities.”Mr. Flynn served as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser for 24 days and resigned after he misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about his contact with a Russian diplomat. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into whether Trump campaign officials collaborated with the Russian government to influence the presidential election.On March 2, weeks after Mr. Flynn’s departure from the Trump administration, the Flynn Intel Group, his consulting firm, filed with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the government of Turkey. Mr. Trump was unaware Mr. Flynn had been consulting on behalf of the Turkish government when he named him national security adviser, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said this month.In its filing, Mr. Flynn’s firm said its work from August to November “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” The filing said his firm’s fee, $530,000, wasn’t paid by the government but by Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin.U.S.-Turkish relations deteriorated in the final year of the Obama administration over disagreements about extraditing Mr. Gulen and U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish forces battling Islamic State. The Turkish government has been demanding Mr. Gulen’s extradition to face charges that he was the architect of an unsuccessful military coup last summer to overthrow Mr. Erdogan. Mr. Gulen, who since 1999 has lived in the Pocono Mountains north of Philadelphia and has a green card giving him permission to live in the U.S., denies involvement. Mr. Erdogan has been trying for years to undermine Mr. Gulen, a onetime ally whom Turkey has now branded as a terrorist leader.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Tuesday he had given the White House and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions new evidence linking Mr. Gulen to the coup.Mr. Woolsey said he attended the Sept. 19 meeting at the urging of the Flynn Intel Group’s chairman and president, Bijan Kian. Mr. Woolsey said he had agreed to be on the group’s advisory board and was offered a consulting fee for his work, but turned it down because of what he heard at the meeting. He held no stake in the firm.“It seemed to be naive,” Mr. Woolsey said about the discussion. “I didn’t put a lot of credibility in it. This is a country of legal process and a Constitution, and you don’t send out folks to haul somebody overseas.”The meeting, held at the Essex House hotel in Manhattan, included Mr. Cavusoglu and Berat Albayrak, Mr. Erdogan’s son-in-law and the country’s energy minister, according to the disclosure documents. Also present were Messrs. Alptekin and Mr. Kian.Mr. Woolsey said he didn’t say anything during the discussion, but later cautioned some attendees that trying to remove Mr. Gulen was a bad idea that might violate U.S. law. Mr. Woolsey said he also informed the U.S. government by notifying Vice President Joe Biden through a mutual friend.The mutual friend confirmed to the Journal he told Mr. Biden about the meeting. Mr. Biden’s spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, other than to say Mr. Biden felt the Gulen matter should be handled through the courts.Mr. Flynn’s spokesman, Mr. Floyd, said that at the meeting “Gen. Flynn did discuss the Flynn Intel Group’s work for Inovo that included gathering information that could lead to a legal case against Mr. Gulen.”Messrs. Kian and Alptekin didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment, nor did a spokesman for Mr. Albayrak. Mr. Cavusoglu’s spokesman referred the Journal to the Turkish Embassy in Washington.In a written statement, the Turkish Embassy acknowledged that Turkish officials met with Mr. Flynn but declined to discuss the conversation. Referencing the Flynn Intel Group’s client, Inovo, the embassy said: “We are not in a position to comment on any engagement between a U.S. consultancy firm and a private company owned by a Turkish businessman.”The disclosure Mr. Flynn’s firm filed with the U.S. government this month said the meeting was “for the purpose of understanding better the political climate in Turkey at the time.”Inovo hired Mr. Flynn on behalf of an Israeli company seeking to export natural gas to Turkey, the filing said, and Mr. Alptekin wanted information on the U.S.-Turkey political climate to advise the gas company about its Turkish investments.Mr. Woolsey, who served as CIA director under President Bill Clinton, offered in September to advise the Trump campaign and opposed Hillary Clinton for president. He briefly served as a senior adviser to the transition team. Appeared in the Mar. 25, 2017, print edition as 'Flynn, Turks Said to Mull Cleric’s Removal.'

      "text" : "What Airbnb has popularized — the peer-to-peer rental of apartments, homes and spare bedrooms — the market has embellished with a roster of new and growing services that offer home sharing.In a sign of a maturing market, these alternatives to Airbnb often carve potential users into niches, targeting, for example, interior design fans or gay travelers. They also reduce the volume of results users generally have to wade through to find the perfect home rental.“There’s such a proliferation of listings out there that finding the signal through the noise is increasingly difficult unless you have a lot of time on your hands,” said Evan Frank, the chief executive of Onefinestay, a home rental brand.These newer services are both chasing and feeding a general expansion in home rentals. In the United States alone, private accommodation rentals tallied about $32 billion in 2016, according to Phocuswright, a travel industry research firm. The company projects that figure will grow to $37 billion in 2018. In 2012, about one in 10 Americans used home-sharing services, compared with one in three in 2015.Companies like VRBO and HomeAway have long worked with travelers looking for vacation homes ranging from ski condos in Vail, Colo., to beach houses in Tulum, Mexico. But the biggest growth has been in cities. “Urban rentals have grown really because of Airbnb, and also online travel agencies like Booking.com getting into rentals,” said Douglas Quinby, the vice president of research for Phocuswright. “Travelers are increasingly cross-shopping against hotels, and often finding cheaper rates.”The following shared-lodging services fall into a few categories but all offer alternatives to hotels, and often to Airbnb.Some services replace the peer-to-peer interaction with hotel-like management in a segment called the “hometel.”Established in London in 2010, the city-focused Onefinestay occupies the luxury end of the shared-accommodations market and makes rentals more hotel-like by replacing each homeowner’s linens and towels with deluxe versions and supplying high-end soaps and shampoos. A staff member greets guests checking in and acts as a concierge, removing any encounter between owner and renter. The company chooses its properties based on a 50-point evaluation meant to instill confidence in those perusing its site that the homes are uniformly clean, well-situated and visually interesting (rates start around $250 a night and most properties have a minimum stay of four or more days).“If you go and look for a summer home in Martha’s Vineyard, you might find things are of completely equivalent quality, priced vastly differently from one another because no intermediary is saying, ‘This is what we believe the value is in the market.’ We’re vouching for the value,” said Mr. Frank, of Onefinestay.Last year, AccorHotels acquired Onefinestay and the service has been expanding since. It is newly in Miami and Rome and just introduced a division that offers accommodations in vacation areas including the Hamptons, and Orange County and Palm Springs, Calif.AccorHotels also acquired a stake in Oasis, a home-sharing service in 23 cities worldwide, last year. Founded in Buenos Aires in 2009, it has a strong presence in South America, and like Onefinestay it selects its homes based on a 50-point inspection that includes, among other things, whether wooden hangers are available in the closets and that there are enough table settings for twice the maximum number of occupants. Oasis also replaces homeowners’ linens with its own, provides toiletries and has staff in each city to check travelers in and offer concierge services.Oasis properties are also vetted based on design. They are strewn throughout desirable neighborhoods in any given destination and include access to local gyms and members clubs. “We’re trying to create a more 360-degree in-depth experience, not just a place to sleep,” said Parker Stanberry, founder and chief executive of Oasis.The company, which aims to expand to at least 60 cities in the next few years, is introducing one in San Francisco (from $140 a night) this month and added Chicago (from $130) and Rome (from 70 euros, about $74) late last year.A few operations began in reaction to what their founders say was bias on the part of hosts from other rental services.After Matthieu Jost and his boyfriend met a host in Barcelona who appeared hostile to homosexuals, he founded Mister B&B in 2013. The service appeals to gay travelers with shared home listings in over 130 countries, and holds “meet-ups” in various cities to connect like-minded travelers.This month, Noirbnb, which targets travelers of color, plans to get started. Its impetus, according to the founders Ronnia Cherry and Stefan Grant, who are black, was based on an Airbnb stay in Atlanta when neighbors to their rented house thought they were robbers and called the police. The company will not say how many units it has enlisted but noted that properties range from studios in New York to entire homes in Okinawa, Japan.Many vacation rental groups focus on a specific region. Perfect Experiences, for example, offers a portfolio of apartment rentals in Paris, London, Provence and Italy along with concierge services to design day trips and tours.With such regional fragmentation, the meta search engine Tripping.com comes in handy. It won’t reduce the number of search results you see, but it will centralize them.“We find most travelers visit five sites before they book,” said Jeff Manheimer, a founder and the chief operating officer for Tripping.com. Its listings include regional and small networks besides the bigger services like VRBO. “A transaction that was offline is increasingly coming online,” he said.Airbnb didn’t invent home sharing, of course, it just commercialized it. On the noncommercial end, Servas International, the nonprofit group that promotes free hosted home sharing, traces its roots to the peace movement that sprang up after World War II. A newer arrival, Homestay was founded in 2013 in Dublin and offers a network of accommodations in over 150 countries where hosts offer affordable lodging, breakfast and local intelligence. Its shared stays average $29 a night in Europe and $32 in the United States.The house-swapping service GuesttoGuest, which is popular in Europe, recently acquired another house-swapping company HomeExchange. They collectively offer more than 350,000 homes and will continue to operate under separate names.HomeExchange just started its Passport Program offering the option to stay at another member’s home without reciprocally hosting them by earning points through hosting other members of the network. Members pay an annual fee starting at $150.GuesttoGuest also allows nonreciprocal hosting based on a points system and does not charge a membership fee.",

      "text" : "PHILADELPHIA—Jody, 57, checked her phone and tapped her foot as she sat in the pews of a courtroom on a recent Friday in March, waiting for the arrival of a court official who was running late to her hearing. Jody, who asked that her last name be withheld, was ready for this day to be over. “So I can get on with my life,” she explained.The grandmother of three was convicted of welfare fraud nearly 30 years ago. She spent about a month in jail and paid a restitution fine of $1,937, which she paid off in monthly installments of $25 over the course of 17 years. Even when her dues were settled, though, the misdemeanor conviction plagued her. Most recently, Jody, who’s been a certified nursing assistant for 38 years, was rejected from a job because a prospective employer noticed her conviction in a background check. “I was furious,” she said.Afterward, Jody sought legal help, and learned through an attorney that she would soon be eligible to have her record sealed, the legal term for restricting access to it. The process wasn’t as quick as Jody might have liked, however: After her lawyer filed an application for the sealing, and Jody paid a $132 fee, she had to wait four months for her hearing that Friday morning in court. Related Story Paying (and Paying and Paying) a Debt to Society Soon, Pennsylvanians like Jody might not need to take so many steps to get their records sealed. A bipartisan bill that’s slated to be introduced in the state legislature would create a system for automating the process—with technology largely supplanting the extra time, money, and legal savvy that’s currently required to seal a record. Criminal-justice reformers see the legislation, dubbed the Clean Slate Act, as a potential model for other states that want to simplify their arduous processes. “The number of people who get expungements and sealings is minuscule compared to the number that are potentially eligible for it,” said Jody’s lawyer Sharon Dietrich, litigation director of Community Legal Services, a Philadelphia-based legal-aid organization.The reform advocates, court administrators, and lawmakers who helped shape the bill essentially want to use the same technology that made background searches pervasive—the digitalization of court records—to make sealing those records simple. Background checks are a relatively recent obstacle to employment for convicted persons. Before the proliferation of the internet, it was rare—and difficult—for employers or landlords to search an applicant’s criminal history. It would require a trip to the courthouse, where a clerk would manually pull a record. As recently as the early 1990s, less than half of companies routinely ran background checks during hiring; now, nearly 90 percent do. An estimated one in three Americans has a criminal record, the same number of Americans who have a college degree.In short, the Clean Slate Act mandates that records are automatically sealed within two months of becoming eligible and prescribes the process by which it happens. It would work like this: A court administrator at the central Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts, or AOPC, would run a monthly query of their electronic-record database to pull all the eligible records for sealing. Eligibility would depend on the severity of a person’s crime and how long it’s been since their last conviction; for a misdemeanor like Jody’s, 10 years would need to pass.Pennsylvania Republicans were attracted to Clean Slate’s potential to shrink state spending.After pulling the records, the administrator would send them electronically to the Pennsylvania State Police, who would have 30 days to cross-reference them with their own comprehensive database, to make sure no conflicts arise. The Pennsylvanians whose records were approved would receive a letter in the mail saying their past convictions would no longer show up in background checks—no application needed. (State police would still have access to them, for law-enforcement purposes.)“It would be a mind-boggling reform,” said Dietrich, who is one of Clean Slate’s architects.The bill is expected to be introduced in the coming weeks by state Senator Scott Wagner, a Republican from south-central York County who’s running for governor in 2018. It’s not expected to face many political obstacles; over half of the Senate, Democrat and Republican, has signed on as co-sponsors. The Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association—which would typically be slow to get behind this kind of reform—doesn’t oppose the legislation. And the Pennsylvania State Police, who support it, have had a hand in crafting the bill, said Scott Price, director of the department’s Bureau of Records and Identification.“All the stakeholders are involved in tweaking some final language,” he said. “It seems to me like we’re fairly well along.”The bill was initially supposed to be introduced on March 22. Price couldn’t disclose the exact issue currently stalling its introduction, but its supporters have been working to guarantee that AOPC’s electronic records can be easily and quickly checked against those of state police. The two agencies use different record systems, so cross-referencing AOPC’s list is not as simple as it may seem. “The data in one doesn’t translate well to the other,” Price said. And a mechanism like this, Price said, “is only as good as its data.” Technological problems have held up Clean Slate before. Last year, the state Senate Appropriations Committee halted the first iteration of the bill because of a data issue. In addition to accounting for misdemeanors, the original bill would have applied to summary records involving very minor crimes—such as disorderly conduct or loitering—that do not require the arrestee to be fingerprinted. But fingerprints—or more specifically, the state identification number that’s attached to them—are the only way to connect a record to an individual in an automated query on the state police department’s system, explained AOPC spokesman James Koval. Because they can’t rely on identification numbers to pull records for these offenders, administrators at the state police department would need to manually run each record sent over by AOPC.The current version of the bill doesn’t bother to reckon with this obstacle. Its writers avoided it by applying Clean Slate only to those with misdemeanors and non-convictions, not lower-level crimes that will still require the standard application process. Amending the legislation to apply to more minor offenses doesn’t yet appear to be in the works. Clean Slate is one in a wave of similar reforms around the country: Since 2013, 40 states and Washington, D.C., have enacted or expanded legislation that mitigates the effects of a criminal record. They include measures like record-sealing; providing certificates of rehabilitation, which tell employers that applicants have proven themselves by spending a certain number of years crime-free; and “ban the box” policies, which restrict employers from asking about applicants’ criminal histories until the last stage of the hiring process.Bipartisan appetite for reform has grown in recent years, particularly when it comes to measures that save government money. Indeed, Pennsylvania Republicans were attracted to Clean Slate’s potential to shrink state spending. The Heritage Foundation, a leading conservative think tank, recently published a report condemning the restrictions placed on formerly incarcerated citizens—“perhaps the most ubiquitous and pernicious” of which are “on their ability to earn a livelihood.”In some ways, Pennsylvania is an unexpected state to initiate such a reform. For one, until last November, misdemeanors weren’t eligible for sealing here, only summary records and non-convictions. On this front, the state is just catching up with national trends: Nearly every state has a mechanism to limit access to misdemeanor records, and a growing number are also including minor felonies.When it comes to Clean Slate, Pennsylvania could open a new channel for reform.And while Pennsylvania is led by Democrat Tom Wolf, who is among the country’s most progressive governors, criminal-justice reform has generally been slow in this swing state. One key factor is the size and nature of its government: With 253 full-time members, Pennsylvania’s quarrelsome state legislature is the largest in the country, and it is dominated by conservative Republicans who represent rural, red-leaning counties sandwiched between the blue strongholds of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.But when it comes to Clean Slate, Pennsylvania could open a new channel for reform. What already sets Pennsylvania apart—and what makes Clean Slate’s automated process technologically possible—is their centralized, electronic record-keeping system, which could serve as blueprint for other states.Here, the court records from each of the 60 judicial districts are transmitted by an email-like system to AOPC. Bill Raftery, a senior analyst at the National Center for State Courts, called the Pennsylvania setup “rare,” because most states have siloed systems where the records from one court can’t be transmitted elsewhere. That’s a huge hurdle for those that want to implement an automatic sealing system, but a few are nevertheless exploring the possibility. Michigan, for example, is moving toward a centralized system, and expressed early interest in a Clean Slate-like mechanism for sealing records, said Jenna Moll, deputy director of the U.S. Justice Action Network, a bipartisan group lobbying for criminal-justice reforms that supported Clean Slate. But Michigan’s potential centralized system would also need the capacity to run a query as AOPC can.Moll said other states are watching Pennsylvania to see just how Clean Slate will unfold. “If you can do this in a way that is effective automatically, you’re going to save a ton of government resources,” she said. In Philadelphia, the wait time for a record-sealing hearing in its overburdened courthouse is currently four months. Once approved, it takes up to two months for the sealing to go in effect.Citing a recent poll from Moll’s group showing 81 percent of Pennsylvania voters support Clean Slate, Wagner told me that “people recognized that a criminal record should not be a life sentence.” He has hired people with criminal histories for his own waste-management company. “This isn’t about gambling—it’s about seeing the person for who they are today and what they can bring to your place of work,” he said.In the Philadelphia courtroom last month, Jody’s lawyer, Dietrich, and a paralegal from the district attorney’s office went over her application while they waited for the trial commissioner, who serves a judge-like role, to arrive. If the paralegal didn’t contest her record’s sealing, then there was no reason that the trial commissioner would. Dietrich signaled to Jody, and said out loud: “You’re approved.” With a clap of her hands, Jody mouthed, “Yes!” She’d gotten affirmation that now, finally, she could get on with her life.",

      "text" : "Stephen K. Bannon — the combative architect of the nationalistic strategy that delivered President Trump to the White House — now finds himself losing ground in an internecine battle within the West Wing that pits the so-called “Bannonites” against a growing and powerful faction of centrist financiers led by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Less than 100 days into Trump’s chaotic presidency, the White House is splintering over policy issues ranging from tax reform to trade. The daily tumult has created an atmosphere of tension and panic within the West Wing, leaving aides fearing for their jobs and cleaving former allies into rivals sniping at one another in the media. The infighting spilled into full view this week after Trump removed Bannon from the National Security Council’s “principals committee,” a reshuffling that left the president’s chief strategist less fully involved in the administration’s daily national security policy while further empowering Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Trump’s new national security adviser. Bannon, an unkempt iconoclast, has generally chafed at the transition from firebomb campaigning to more modulated governing and for weeks has vented about the possibility of quitting, one person close to him said. This account of the latest West Wing turmoil comes from interviews with more than 20 White House officials and people close to those in the administration, many of whom requested anonymity to offer candid assessments. White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, walk outside the West Wing on Wednesday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Despite the demotion, Bannon attended Wednesday’s security council meeting, and his friends and allies say the position on the Cabinet-level security committee was always supposed to be temporary — a way for Bannon to keep watch over retired Gen. Michael Flynn, the controversial former national security adviser who was fired in February after he misled the Vice President Pence about his contacts with the Russians. But the benign explanation for Bannon’s removal belies the growing strife between Bannon, Kushner and Gary Cohn, the National Economic Council director. A registered Democrat who previously ran Goldman Sachs, Cohn is close to Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, the president’s oldest daughter and adviser. [Inside Trump’s White House, New York moderates spark infighting and suspicion] Fairly or unfairly, Bannon has borne the blame for several specific policy and political failures, including the scattershot drafting and implementation of Trump’s first travel ban and the strategy and approach to dealing with the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which ultimately helped tank the Republican health-care bill by failing to support it. The battle over control of a pro-Trump outside group also pitted Bannon, Republican super-donor Rebekah Mercer and her father, Robert, against Kushner. And Bannon has felt the brunt of general frustrations surrounding the security council. In the early days of the administration, he elevated himself, without Trump’s knowledge, to the principals committee, a move that infuriated the president. Bannon insisted, along with Kushner, on keeping certain staffers over the objection of McMaster. But the ultimate argument against him, said one person with knowledge of the situation, is that “Bannon isn’t making ‘Dad’ look good.” Inside the partnership between Stephen Bannon and the Mercer family Embed Copy Share Play Video3:47 (Bastien Inzaurralde,Dani Player/The Washington Post) Before he became President Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon was involved in several ventures with Republican mega-donor Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah. Before his work in the White House, Stephen K. Bannon was involved in several ventures with mega-donor Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah. (Bastien Inzaurralde, Dani Player/The Washington Post) As Kushner has expanded his portfolio and consolidated his already vast power — the 36-year-old has been called “the Trump whisperer,” with a direct line to the president — he has surrounded himself with a small group of outsiders who largely hail from the ranks of business and Wall Street. The group includes Dina Powell, an Egyptian-born former Goldman Sachs official who served in George W. Bush’s administration. Both she and Cohn are part of Kushner’s newly announced Office of American Innovation, an internal team devoted to streamlining government. Bannon and his populist allies view Kushner’s circle with growing suspicion, worrying aloud that the group — whom they dismiss as “the Democrats,” “the New Yorkers” or, simply, “Goldman” — are pushing Trump in a “Democrat Lite” direction. Kushner’s allies, meanwhile, label Bannon’s crowd as “the Bannonites,” “the Nationalists” or “Breitbart,” the name of the incendiary conservative website he previously ran. Bannon, grousing to friends, has cast the tensions as a battle between the globalists and the liberal Democrats, whom he worries are eager to undercut the populist movement that helped lift Trump to victory. Looming over him daily on his office walls are the promises that Trump made during the campaign, which he methodically checks off. Cohn has met with Democrats on several occasions and appears much more comfortable offering lawmakers olive branches than does Bannon, who during the health- care fight argued in favor of forcing a vote on the doomed bill to establish a public list of Republican traitors. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich cast the disagreements as important and weighty policy debates. “It’s not about petty soap-opera stuff,” Gingrich said. “Bannon represents a very fundamental change in how we think about economic policy, taking us back to the era from Alexander Hamilton up through the 1920s when we were a much more national economy. Gary represents the New York international worldview and is a very competent and smart guy. There’s a natural tension. “I think it’s very helpful to have the tension and the arguments,” he added. “I think presidents are much better served if they have different sources of information.” The president, asked by reporters Thursday on Air Force One if a staff shake-up is looming, said he thought the administration had “already shaken things up.” “I think we’ve had one of the most successful 13 weeks in the history of the presidency,” Trump said, wrongly referring to the 11 weeks he has been in office. Some friends of both Bannon and Kushner, who talk daily and still have a cordial rapport, say the tensions are mostly driven by policy. [White House disavows two controversial tax ideas hours after officials say they’re under consideration] In February, for instance, a group of former Republican Cabinet secretaries met with Cohn to pitch him on the idea of a carbon tax, arguing it would help reduce fossil fuel emissions while also addressing budget issues. Some left the meeting believing Cohn was open to the idea. Bannon was furious when he caught wind of the proposal, saying the White House was veering too far from Trump’s core nationalist principles as it molded its economic policy. A meeting last week at the White House at the behest of Kushner and Cohn to discuss health care with Ezekiel Emanuel, brother of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and one of the architects of President Obama’s health-care bill, was another fault line. The mere existence of the staff-level discussion with Emanuel — who had previously met with Trump three times — raised concerns among conservatives that the president was serious about his threat to work with Democrats after his initial health-care proposal failed. Bannon, allies said, still has the president’s ear, especially on key issues like immigration, where he and Trump are in a complete “mind meld.” But the chief strategist has struggled to adjust to the more regimented mores of the White House. One friend said he hates attending meetings, bemoans the need to frequently wear suits, and finds the government bureaucracy stifling. While living in Los Angeles, Bannon would sometimes participate in Breitbart conference calls before showering and in a T-shirt or bathrobe; his D.C. staff would joke about the last time he got a haircut. Some of those who resent Kushner’s rising power have compared him to Icarus, the youth in Greek mythology who flew too close to the sun and melted his wings. But because Kushner holds so much clout, many of his rivals fear bad-mouthing him and train their ire on his deputies instead. “When you complain about Gary or Dina, you’re really complaining about Jared and what he’s doing, because you’re not able to complain about Jared around here,” said one senior White House official. But one administration official warned that Bannon was playing “a dangerous game” because it is “not a smart strategy to go up against the president and his family. That’s a game Steve will never win.” Patrick J. Caddell, a veteran pollster who advises Breitbart and is friends with Bannon, said that “an outsider administration is vulnerable to these kinds of cracks.” “Steve is taking the slings and arrows, but I hope Trump understands that the attacks on Bannon are an attempt to undermine Trump,” Caddell said. “That’s the crucial point. Steve is essential to him, the only person who has a clue why the president was elected and why he’s there.” politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

One senior official pointed to Trump’s interview Wednesday with the New York Times, during which at least six senior White House staffers, including Pence, crowded into the Oval Office. “Why were they there?” asked the official, saying they should have been working on other tasks. “Now the expectation is you have to be in every picture and every meeting.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, dismissed reports of palace intrigue. “There are many serious issues at hand, which the president has been totally focused on, and the only conflicts his advisers are concerned with are those that are impacting the lives and safety of Americans, as well as the citizens of the world,” she said. Trump, for his part, enjoys a somewhat chaotic management style and so far hasn’t aligned entirely with either camp. Aides say one moment the president will praise Bannon and sound out nationalist themes. The next, he’ll see a headline about “President Bannon” and grimace. Tom Hamburger, Rosalind S.

      "text" : "ADDIS ABABA (Reuters Life!) - Got 48 hours to spare in Addis Ababa -- Africa's diplomatic hub and one of the highest capital cities in the world? Reuters correspondents with local knowledge give tips on how to make the most of a short stay.FRIDAY\n5 p.m. Have a couple of cold beers by the pool during happy hour at the Hilton Hotel. You'll rub shoulders with African Union diplomats, United Nation's workers and government ministers so the conversation is always controversial and interesting.8 p.m. Ethiopians serve their food on a spongy pancake called injera. Well-cooked pieces of lamb called tibs are particularly good as are the array of vegetables eaten during fasting times. Hop in a taxi (the blue ones are cheapest and perfectly safe) to Fasika. It's one of the swankiest restaurants in town but a great place to try the local cuisine for the first time. A lively dance show takes you on a whistle-stop tour of Ethiopian culture.10 p.m. With a belly full of Ethiopian food, now's a good time to head to a traditional bar known as an Azmari bet. Try the Kazanchis area and ask your taxi driver for recommendations. Fendika is a good one. Azmaris are the performers who sing songs often made up on the spot. If you're lucky they might even sing one about you.SATURDAY 9 a.m. Many visitors to Addis are overwhelmed by the scale of visible poverty and the street children they see on almost every corner. Instead of doling out change randomly, pay a quick visit to Hope Enterprises on Churchill Road and buy some meal tickets. Every day almost 700 children redeem the tickets for a healthy dinner at the center.9:15 a.m. Now you're in the right spot to indulge in some souvenir shopping. Shops carrying everything from Ethiopian silver to memorabilia from Ethiopia's brief Italian occupation line Churchill Road. Take your time to compare prices across a few stores.11:00 a.m. If the shopping bug has bitten, why not hop in a taxi to the Mercato? Some say it's Africa's biggest open-air market but nobody really knows. Just watch your pockets. But don't worry too much. Addis is one of Africa's safest capitals and crime is rare. 1 p.m. After a trip to London at the turn of the 20th century, Princess Taitu asked her husband Emperor Menelik II to build a hotel like the ones she had seen there. The Itegue Taitu Hotel was the result and is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Addis. Go for a bite and ask to be served outside the upstairs bedrooms in the main building.3 p.m. Time for coffee. And you're in the best place in the world for that. Legend has it the coffee bean was discovered centuries ago by a shepherd in northern Ethiopia and Ethiopians take their coffee very seriously indeed. Tamoca on Algeria Street is the oldest coffee shop in town and serves a great macchiato (espresso with milk). Coffee beans roast in front of your eyes in stylish Italian art-deco surroundings. They're for sale too.5 p.m. English Premier League football obsesses Africans. And Meskel Square -- where all Addis roads meet -- is a truly unique place to witness their passion. A giant screen illuminates the west end of the square and hundreds of Addis Ababans regularly congregate in the square to cheer on their teams. Arsenal is by far the most popular. 8 p.m. Said to be Bob Geldof's favorite Italian restaurant, Castelli's elegant wood-panelled dining room has played host to Swedish royalty, Bill Clinton, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Consistency is the seller - the restaurant has served up its tasty selection of pastas, seafood and steaks through all manner of strife. It famously stayed open the night Ethiopia's communist regime was toppled in 1991. The antipasti buffet is a must.11 p.m. If you fancy late drinks, you could start at the Sheraton Hotel's Gaslight and watch the city's rich at play. Then across town to Memo's nightclub for a recharging snack in its courtyard restaurant (order the chirro), before a dance with the less spoiled locals and a smattering of expats. Or you could head to Le Bateau Ivre in Kazanchis -- one of the most reliably raucous and fun late, late bars in town.SUNDAY 9 a.m. - The best thing about the wonderful Ethnological Museum/Haile Selassie's Palace on Algeria Street is that you get to see the real former bedrooms, bathrooms and dressing rooms of the famously regal and elegant Emperor Haile Selassie and his wife.12 p.m. A leisurely lunch at Blue Tops across the road. You have to try the ice cream.3 p.m. The Derg Monument on Churchill Avenue is a surprisingly haunting reminder of Ethiopia's difficult years of communist rule. The site also houses a moving pictorial memorial to Cuban soldiers who died fighting alongside Ethiopian troops during the country's war against Somalia in 1977/78.6 p.m. Watch the sun set over your Addis weekend at the fine Top View restaurant.",

      "text" : "Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) resigned from office April 10 after a year-long scandal. He was facing impeachment charges. (The Washington Post) Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) resigned Monday after fighting for more than a year against allegations he used public resources to carry out and conceal an affair with his former top aide. Pressure built on Bentley to step down over the sex scandal as state lawmakers opened impeachment hearings against him this week and state Republican officials called for him to leave the governor's mansion. Bentley also pleaded guilty on Monday to two misdemeanor charges related to covering up the alleged affair, one for failing to file a major contribution report and another for knowingly using campaign contributions for personal use, according to the state's attorney general office. “I love the people of this state with all my heart,” he told reporters as he announced his resignation inside the Alabama State Capitol. On his way to officially resign, Bentley showed up to the Montgomery County Jail and posed for a mug shot. (Screen shot) The events leading to the end of Bentley's career were spelled out in the 3,000 pages of a report released by the House Judiciary Committee attorney Friday detailing various indiscretions the governor may allegedly tried to keep secret as he carried out an affair with his married aide, Rebekah Caldwell Mason. The report says Bentley texted heart-eyed emojis to Caldwell -- texts that were linked up to his now ex-wife's iPad -- and made threats to the first lady's staff to keep the affair secret. The report also detailed what allegedly went on behind closed doors when Mason, according to the report, left the office “with her hair tousled and her clothing in disarray.” [Former Alabama governor Robert Bentley's year from hell, a timeline] The Alabama Ethics Commission recommended Wednesday the governor be charged with four felonies related to campaign finance and ethics fraud tied to his affair, including an allegation he illegally loaned Mason campaign money for legal funds. Under a deal struck with the state attorney general's office, Bentley plead guilty to misdemeanor charges in an effort to avoid felony charges and potential jail time. Under the plea deal, Bentley will face up to a year of probation and 100 hours of community service, which he is expected to perform in his capacity as a licensed dermatologist. He must turn over some $37,000 in campaign funds to the state. He could face jail time, but it's unlikely. Alabama governor: 'I will be leaving the office today' Embed Copy Share Play Video1:14 Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) announced his resignation on April 10 as a legislative panel suspended a hearing that could have led to his impeachment on accusations stemming from his relationship with a former adviser, according to officials. (Reuters) Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) announced his resignation on April 10 as a legislative panel suspended a hearing that could have led to his impeachment on accusations stemming from his relationship with a former adviser, according to officials. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) announced his resignation on April 10. (Reuters) Up until the moment he resigned Monday, Bentley fervently denied he had done anything that should cost him his job. He never fully admitted to an affair, even after a secretly taped phone call leaked of him professing his love to a woman named “Rebekah.” “I do not plan to resign,” Bentley said on the Alabama state Capitol steps just Friday morning. “I have done nothing illegal.” But a series of events unfolded over the past few days that intensified the pressure on the Republican governor to make a decision about whether to keep defending himself in both the state House and the courts or to step down. Bentley did not react to the 3,000-page report released Friday afternoon, which, among other salacious details, alleged he opened a hotel door while on a business trip in Washington, D.C., in his boxers expecting to see Mason. By Saturday, Alabama's Supreme Court agreed to let state House impeachment proceedings go ahead. By Sunday, the state Republican Party officially called on the governor to step down. By Monday afternoon, Bentley booked himself at the Montgomery County Jail. By evening, Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey (R) was sworn in as governor; Alabama's second female governor in state history. Bentley's resignation comes a little more than a year and a half before the second of his two terms is up. The 74-year-old former dermatologist was an unlikely choice to rise to the state's top job. The little-known state legislator surprised many in Alabama politics by making it to a runoff for the governor's race in 2010. In a state familiar with corruption, Bentley leaned heavily on his wholesome, grandfatherly demeanor — he was a deacon and Sunday school teacher at a Baptist church in Tuscaloosa, which Mason also attended. Despite struggling to achieve any significant legislative accomplishment, in his 2014 reelection race, Bentley won the largest percentage of the vote — 63 percent — of any modern-day Republican governor in Alabama. Then, scandal. In August 2015, Bentley's wife of 50 years, Dianne, abruptly filed for divorce. Rumors of an affair between Bentley and Mason had swirled around Alabama politics for months before the story finally broke open in March 2016. Bentley fired the state's top cop, who then went to AL.com, Alabama's largest statewide news organization, with sordid details of Bentley and Mason's alleged affair. He was armed with a phone call between Bentley and a woman he addresses as “Rebekah” that, unknown to the two on the phone, was being taped by Bentley's now ex-wife. “Baby, let me know what I am going to do when I start locking the door,” Bentley is heard saying. “If we are going to do what we did the other day, we are going to have to start locking the door.” [An inside look at how Bentley's sex scandal broke wide open] politics the-fix Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false 5-Minute Fix newsletter Keeping up with politics is easy now.

See all newsletters A few days later, defiant Bentley asked God for forgiveness for an unknown sin while he was touring a jail to promote his prison reform legislation. He said at a news conference that he loved some of his staff more than others, and he and responded “no” when a reporter asked if that phone call was the only indiscretion. But he never quite admitted to an affair. As he defended himself, Bentley was walking an increasingly lonely road. Alabama Republicans in the state legislature had little to lose and much to gain by abandoning the governor, who had few ties to the GOP establishment. If Bentley didn't go of his own accord, Alabama Republicans say he would have been impeached in the next month or two anyway. The House Judiciary Committee defended its right to impeach Bentley in a last-minute court battle that played out over the weekend. Bentley will become the third top Alabama public official in less than a year to lose his job over a scandal and/or face jail time. Former House speaker Mike Hubbard (R) was sentenced in July to four years in prison after being convicted of violating state ethics laws he helped pass by using his political leverage to increase his personal wealth. And in September, a state ethics court suspended Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, citing “clear and convincing” evidence that he tried to block same-sex marriage in the state after the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing it. Bentley will be Alabama's fourth governor to resign while in office. Most recently, former Alabama governor Guy Hunt (R) resigned in 1993 after being convicted of taking $200,000 from his inaugural fund for personal use. Former Democratic governor Don Siegelman just finished serving a seven-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2006 — three years after he left office — for corruption related to bribery.",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-wants-tax-plan-to-cut-corporate-rate-to-15-1493057898WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump has ordered White House aides to draft a tax plan that slashes the corporate tax rate to 15%, even if that means a loss of revenue, according to people familiar with the directive.During a meeting in the Oval Office last week, Mr. Trump told staff he wants a massive tax cut to sell to the American public, these people said. He told aides it was less important to him that such a plan could add to the federal budget deficit, though that might make it difficult to sell to GOP lawmakers who are wary of such a large tax cut. Mr. Trump told his team to “get it done” in time to release a plan by Wednesday, the people said. Capital Journal is WSJ.com’s home for politics, policy and national security news.Mr. Trump’s willingness to let deficits run higher also could hinder the passage of tax cuts that are permanent. Congressional Republicans plan on using a procedural tool known as reconciliation that would allow the tax legislation to pass with a 51-vote majority in the Senate, instead of the usual 60 votes. Under those rules, changes can’t add to deficits beyond a decade.“It’s the same discussion they had about the Bush tax cuts in the previous administration: Are you better off having a smaller cut that is permanent, or a larger cut that is temporary?” said Mick Mulvaney, the president’s budget director, in an interview last week.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn are scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss Mr. Trump’s tax proposals with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R., Texas). The meeting comes in advance of a Wednesday announcement by Mr. Trump about his principles for tax policy.“This is part of our continuing dialogue with the Trump administration on tax reform,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. During the campaign, Mr. Trump proposed to cut corporate rates to 15% from 35%. There likely aren’t enough business tax breaks that could be repealed to offset the fiscal cost, meaning such a move would increase budget deficits. Roughly, each percentage-point cut in the tax rate lowers federal revenue by $100 billion over a decade, so a 20-point cut would cost the government $2 trillion over a decade, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.If such a deficit-financed tax cut passed under reconciliation, the provisions would expire after 10 years, because bills passed that way can’t increase deficits beyond the typical 10-year time frame against which tax and spending policies are projected.Some White House advisers have warned that changes that aren’t permanent would undercut the rationale for a corporate-tax cut, which is to boost business investment. Businesses are “making long-term capital decisions. People are deciding to move this to the United States, and…they need some permanence of the tax code,” Mr. Cohn said at a conference last week.Democrats are against large tax cuts for corporations, especially when Mr. Trump is already proposing cuts to government spending programs that Democrats prioritize, such as housing, arts and the environment.“They will lose a boatload of revenue that we can’t afford to lose and far more than this team will offset by closing loopholes,” said Jared Bernstein, who was an economic adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden. Cutting marginal tax rates for businesses could generate some economic growth, Mr. Bernstein said, but not nearly enough to pay for itself with increased revenue.“These promises about all kinds of growth and investment that are going to be triggered by these tax cuts never appear, and the empirical historical record is clear on that,” Mr. Bernstein said. Mr. Trump’s call for a 15% corporate tax rate puts him below the low end of recent proposals. Former President Barack Obama sought a 28% rate for most companies. A 2014 Republican plan had a 25% corporate rate. And House Republicans want a 20% rate, with the cost covered by including a border-adjustment feature that taxes imports and exempts exports. Mr. Trump’s White House has sent mixed messages about whether it would support the border-adjustment plan. Asked Monday if the president’s tax plan would be revenue-neutral, meaning it wouldn’t add to the debt, Mr. Mnuchin told reporters that it would “pay for itself with economic growth.” By that, he meant that the administration expects to be able to project faster growth due to tax cuts, which would in turn increase revenue and avert the risk of bigger budget deficits. Many economists say that without a big pickup in productivity and labor-force growth, though, it is uncertain whether the tax-policy changes could drive an economic expansion on a sustained basis.So far, Mr. Trump is sticking with core elements of his campaign tax plan, showing no signs of molding political promises to legislative dynamics in Congress or any significant fiscal constraints.Mr. Trump’s aides have been working on a detailed tax proposal, but that isn’t ready yet. The announcement on Wednesday is expected to focus instead on broader principles, including proposed changes to the individual tax rates. Mr. Trump has said he wants to reduce the number of brackets for individual payers and to deliver tax cuts to the middle class.Mr. Trump’s statement last week that he would announce details of his plan later this week caught his team off guard, said people familiar with the matter.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on April 12, Mr. Trump said he wouldn’t release even a set of tax principles before Congress passes major health-care legislation, which hasn’t happened.The timing also was a surprise because, for weeks, top advisers in the White House have said they would like to forge consensus with lawmakers on a single plan before releasing more details. The U.S. has the developed world’s highest statutory corporate tax rate, and advocates for lower corporate rates say the system discourages job creation and investment in the U.S. Including state and local taxes, the U.S.’s corporate rate is 39.1%, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Over the past decade, other countries have been lowering their tax rates to attract corporate investment, while the U.S. has left its federal rate at 35%. American companies have thus increasingly found ways to book their profits in low-tax foreign jurisdictions. The gap in corporate tax rates between the U.S. and other countries is smaller under a measure that looks at taxes as a share of income after deductions and other breaks, also known as the average rate. In 2012, the U.S. average tax rate was 29%, according to a recently released CBO study. That still ranked third-highest in the G20, and the U.S. rate was more than 10 percentage points above Australia, Canada, Germany and the U.K.The actual tax rates paid by companies vary widely, with global high-tech and pharmaceutical companies paying relatively low rates and retailers and primarily domestic firms paying higher rates.

      "text" : "He lifted his glasses and let them rest on his forehead before taking hold of my right leg. “Pull me closer,” he said.I pulled.“Push me away.”I pushed.I thought: This is the game lovers play. Pull me closer, push me away, each action holding the promise of a specific outcome: If I push you away, you will come after me. If I pull you closer, you will let me. But he wasn’t my lover. He was my doctor.And then I felt my leg give way, a sensation of water running downhill. I came back to myself. To the blue-white light of the exam room. The crinkly sound of the paper on the table. The feeling of his hand on my skin as again he told me to pull him closer. To push him away. The sensation of weakness once more, this time in my left leg.He made no comment, but I saw the studied flatness of his expression. I looked down at the shrunken muscles in my feet, at my paralyzed toes. And then I looked up at him. He reached into his lab coat, pulled out his reflex hammer and took aim at my knee. My leg jumped, the spasm of a too-brisk response.“You are fine,” he said, his words inflected by the Syrian accent that gave me so much comfort. “Trust me.”I tried to trust him, but I wasn’t fine and we both knew it. My motor neurons were failing. They had been failing for two decades, slowly, in a sleepy subterranean wave.I knew I was lucky. Motor neuron disease is incurable and most people who have it die within a year or two, maybe five. But I was still alive. Soldiering on.So when my doctor said I was fine, he meant he had discovered nothing new and alarming during this exam. I was holding steady. I wasn’t fine but I wasn’t dying, either.We met every three months. The regularity of these appointments, and the close monitoring that the schedule suggested, should have terrified me. Instead, it made me feel safe. As time passed, I realized it wasn’t just the monitoring that brought me comfort but the doctor himself.I liked the way he wore his hair cut short, so I could see the contours of his skull. I liked the shape of his hands and the patient way he answered my questions. And if I hesitated, not wanting to talk about embarrassing symptoms, he would soften his voice and give me a mild look. “Tell me,” he’d say, and I’d tell him.One night I dreamed of him standing in the middle of a wasteland, a world exploded by war, his sleeve pushed back so I could see the watch on his wrist. The dial read 10 minutes to 8. In the dream I thought, “Oh, thank God. I still have time.” But when I woke up, I felt only terror. “Time’s running out,” I thought.I sent my doctor an email and he responded right away. “Do not worry,” he wrote. “You are fine.” I felt the force of his words, the shelter of his certainty.It’s axiomatic to say that patients with serious illnesses fall in love with their doctors, seeing them as points of light in an otherwise dismal sky. But I knew this wasn’t love. It was desperation, a finger-hold on a cliff before the fall.I wasn’t in love with him, but I had come to depend on him. I was accustomed to taking care of myself and I had let him take care of me. I let him see that I was scared. And when I let him see my fear, I had to see it, too. My own fragility. The stuff I couldn’t just power through.Despite this, he gave me hope. This was the ammunition that fueled my fight.“Pull me closer,” he said each time we met. “Push me away.”I asked about his family in Syria.“You don’t want to hear this,” he said, as formal and as courteous as ever. But eventually he told me about his reckless nephews. His brother-in-law with cancer. His mother and sisters who remained there, watching daily for things that could fall from the sky: bombs, pieces of aircraft, the flotsam of war.Inadvertently, I winced and turned away. When I looked at him once more, he was watching me recoil from things unknown.“You are fine,” he said, and smiled.Not long after, three Muslim students were shot in our town, killed when they answered a knock at their apartment door. In San Bernardino, Calif., a newly married couple, their toddler at her grandmother’s house, opened fire in a room full of county office workers. And all the news was about shooters from ISIS, Muslims and the threat they posed to the American way of life.At my next appointment, I could tell my doctor was preoccupied.“What’s wrong?” I asked softly.“It is nothing,” he said. He wouldn’t look at me.I thought about the way he had come to America and chosen to work at a big state teaching hospital so he could help poor people. How he had come here to be safe and to offer safety. I had never seen him look as defeated as he did now.“Tell me,” I said.He hesitated and then said he was afraid for his wife and children. He would be fine, but he worried about them. “People are crazy,” he said. And then he began to talk about leaving America, maybe moving to Dubai.“You will break my heart,” I said. I thought I was joking, but a minute later I was weeping.I understood why he wanted to leave. But I also knew that if I was still alive, it was because of him. His bravery mattered when mine faltered. His mantra: “You are fine. You are fine,” cut through my doubt when it seemed there was no light.How many effects of warfare are invisible, revealed only in human trembling, that shivering language of fear? The twitching, failing muscle. The bullet in the air. Each equivalent to the other, it turns out, when the coming damage is unknown, but certain.I wanted him to be safe. The same thing he wanted for me. And I knew I was helpless to procure that safety for him, because some people are, indeed, crazy. And he was just as helpless when it came to halting the march of my illness.I said his name and he turned to face me.“I am with you,” he said, as if I had asked him for something, his voice fierce again. His face filled with resolve. “I am not going anywhere.”“You’re O.K., too,” I replied, wiping my eyes, knowing my words were futile but needing to say something anyway. “Nothing’s going to happen,” I said, even though I could not possibly know if he would be all right. Even so, I barreled on. “Your family will be all right. You’ll be all right.”He smiled gently and shook his head. And then I realized something: He had never once tried to reassure me about the future in that way, with false hope. He had only ever spoken about the present, telling me what he knew to be true. I was still fine. I was not yet headed for a quick death. And that was what had given me comfort.“You are fine,” I offered softly, thinking that, for at least this moment, he was. But as soon as I said this, he flicked his glance away and did not reply.I did not blame him for ducking the conversation the way you would dodge a downpour of rain. We could hear nothing of war in that cool place, where the only sounds came from the elevators rising and falling. There were no bullets flying. No audible dying off of this neuron or the next. These things are silent until they are upon us, and by then it is too late.So we sat without speaking, together in the dark night of that bright room. But if he had taught me anything, it was that comfort resides in the rituals of care, the steady application of optimism, the shivering light of faith in the fact that I was still okay.And so I thought: What can I offer when the only thing I have is hope? And then: You can be his patient. You can let him take care of you.Almost as soon as I thought this, he reached into his lab coat for his hammer. “Go like this,” he said, cupping his fingers so that one hand hooked into the other. When I did, he told me to pull. Then he hit my knee with the hammer and resumed his exam.",

      "text" : "Story highlightsLawmakers want to question Kushner about meeting with Russian banker and ambassadorRussian banker who met with Kushner has deep ties to the Russian government (CNN)The Russian bank chairman who met with Jared Kushner in December isn't your ordinary banker.His state-run bank has been under US sanctions for nearly three years.He was appointed to his job by Russian President Vladimir Putin after eight years at Russia's biggest state-owned commercial bank. And he graduated from the Russian academy of Federal Security Service, which trains people to work in Russia's intelligence and security forces.Sergey Gorkov's meeting with Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and one of his closest advisers, will be scrutinized by congressional investigators probing links between Trump associates and the Russian government. Gorkov is chairman of VneshEconomBank, or VEB, a Russian development agency that has been under US sanctions since July 2014.Read MoreThe meeting is raising questions both because of the sanctions and because Kushner spent years as a real-estate developer and was trying to attract financing for a building project of his in Manhattan.The White House said Kushner was acting as a Trump adviser -- not as a private developer -- when he met with Gorkov. Sergei Gorkov's bank has been under US sanctions for three years.\"He was a conduit and to -- to leaders and that's until we had a State Department, a functioning place for people to go,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday. VEB confirmed the meeting with Kushner in a statement to CNN, though described Kushner in his role as head of Kushner Companies, not as a representative of Trump. \"During 2016 the bank's management repeatedly met with representatives of the world's leading financial institutions in Europe, Asia and America ... including the head of Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner,\" the VEB statement said. A spokesman for the Kremlin said Tuesday the Russian government was not aware of the meeting, calling it \"absolutely the bank's prerogative\" and stressed that the discussion was one of dozens held to discuss the bank's long-term strategy.Senate Intelligence Committee member Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told CNN's \"New Day\" Tuesday morning that it was \"interesting\" that VEB \"seemed to contradict\" Kushner's statement that he was acting as a campaign official when he met with the bank president. \"I'm sure that that will be an issue that we'll try to clarify,\" Collins said.Close ties to Russian governmentThe meeting between Kushner and Gorkov does not violate the US sanctions, and it is not unusual for businesses under sanctions to meet with US officials, experts said.\"I don't see any problem in having a meeting,\" said Paul Saunders, executive director of the Center for the National Interest, a Washington, DC, think tank. \"The prohibitions relate to doing business with the banks, not to talking to them.\"Trump said during his presidential campaign that he was open to reconsidering the sanctions against Russia. The sanctions weakened much of the Russian finance sector by barring Americans and US companies from buying the debt of Russian financial institutions, which limits their ability to raise money.Kushner, Senate investigators to meet in wake of Russian ambassador meetings\"Right after the election, there was an expectation on the part of Russia that sanctions will be lifted,\" said Alevtina Guseva, a Boston University expert on Russian finance.VEB is a state-owned Russian corporation formed in 2007 that is closely tied to the Russian government. Its chairman is appointed by the Russian president. The Russian prime minister is chairman of the bank supervisory board.The bank has helped rescue financially troubled oligarchs and has financed infrastructure projects such as the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi that are too risky for commercial banks. Last year, the bank restructured 200 billion roubles (roughly $3.5 billion) in debts that were affiliated with Sochi projects.It was disclosed on Monday that Kushner agreed to speak to the Senate Intelligence Committee for its inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government in its effort to sway the 2016 election toward Trump. Lawmakers also want to question Kushner about his meeting in December with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions in 2014 after Russian annexed part of neighboring Ukraine.CNN's Simon Ostrovsky, Matthew Chance, Emma Burrows and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.",

Although it was the mid-1970s, ladies with blue-tinted hair ate sandwiches without crusts in the tearoom. And as we shopped, I wandered through what seemed like endless displays of textures, shapes, colors and smells.I was a fearful child from a household with little money and even less attention paid to children. Hutzler’s was the highlight of that year. I have no idea what I bought, but I still remember the experience.Hutzler’s went out of business long ago, and I live in New York City now. When I go shopping, I go to Barneys, ABC, the first floor of Saks. Can I afford to buy most of what these places offer? No. But I’m not there for the purchase, I’m there for the experience.Perhaps I’m shallow, but I’ve always been easily moved by beautiful objects and items. When I was a child, I was obsessed with Fabergé eggs, and I cruised the local yard sales for rhinestone necklaces and scraps of velvet and lace.A good department store floor has the same effect on me. I hear myself audibly gasp and sigh at the jewelry on display under glass countertops, and the right fabric draped in the right way over a mannequin makes my heart contract.I try all the clasps on all the purses. I listen to the strangely satisfying clicks of compacts and lipsticks. I smell the perfumes. I finger dresses I’d need a second mortgage to buy.Sometimes I fantasize that I’m the kind of woman who wears these things, who tosses down a credit card without thinking, who scoops up silks and chiffons and exquisite bottles of face cream, and then glides out with big bags swinging from each arm.The fantasizing is part of the pleasure. I don’t really want to be that woman, because that would mean not being me. But a few times a year, I like to play at being her.I’m rarely alone on these excursions. I wouldn’t want to be. My aunt and I have been close all my life, and I have no doubt the relationship was in part cemented by what became our annual trips to Hutzler’s.When my friend’s sister died, I took her shopping for something to wear at the service; when I got pregnant, she took me shopping for maternity clothes. These afternoons of intimacy and friendship will be with me long after the clothes have become stained, threadbare and unwearable.With online shopping, making purchases has become an algorithm-driven, frictionless experience of terrifying efficiency. Amazon allows you to restock your toilet paper by clicking a button. Net-a-Porter delivers Chloé and Balenciaga to your door.It’s easy, it’s fast, and it’s completely devoid of any experiential pleasure.Shopping by phone or computer has always seemed to me depressingly isolated, stripped not only of the potential for human bonding, but also reflecting our culture’s distaste for pleasure and play, its distrust of the sensual. We live in a time of instrumentalization and efficiency, where everything is faster, smoother and more goal-oriented.We eat to get the right nutrients, vacation to be refreshed when we return to work, move our bodies to stay slim. Online retailers cater to this utilitarian drive, and we in turn forget there are other ways, that there is value in a pleasurable experience even if no item is delivered the next day.Of course, these efficient systems make us more efficient consumers. While I won’t claim that hanging out at Barneys or ABC makes me an anti-consumerist rebel, I do feel a sneaky joy in how little I actually buy, even while benefiting so thoroughly from these palaces of consumption. If you can rid yourself of the need to own everything that pleases you, suddenly these palaces become playgrounds: facilitators of tactile delight, not just mechanisms for buying.Certain items have caught my imagination so intensely that I’ve felt the need to see them again and again. I have often found myself saying I was going to visit a purse or a dress — there was a slouchy leather bag at the Prada store in SoHo that I was essentially dating for several months in 2011.In this way, my relationship to shopping is similar to the way my friends visit museums: the thrill of exposure without the need to possess. Also, I get to touch and smell everything, while they only get to look.When I think about it this way, I start to wonder if maybe it’s not that I don’t care about owning anything, but rather that I already own everything. I have always felt, as a New Yorker, that all of New York is mine.I can walk the streets until I drop from exhaustion; pop in and out of the Met; run, sail and people-watch in Central Park; have a picnic on the Brooklyn Bridge; swim at Jones Beach; marvel at the architecture from all vantage points.And who’s to say that Barneys and ABC aren’t also in this vast real estate portfolio of mine? In France, at the time of Louis XIV, anyone who was dressed with a modicum of decency could stroll into Versailles and lounge about the Grand Canal or watch the king dine.So too can we New Yorkers waltz into the most glamorous, supposedly exclusive shopping havens in the world and spend hours in sensory heaven, building our friendships, and without buying anything.There’s an old saying that if you have to ask the price of something, you can’t afford it. My advice: Don’t ask the price. You already own the experience.",

      "text" : "President Trump entered his 11th week in office Friday in crisis mode, his governing agenda at risk of being subsumed by escalating questions about the White House’s conduct in the Russia probe — which the president called a “witch hunt.” Trump and his senior aides spent much of the day on the defensive, parrying the latest reports that senior administration officials had potentially acted improperly in the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Moscow’s meddling in the U.S. elections and possible links between Trump’s campaign and Russian officials. White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the actions of three senior White House aides who, according to media reports, helped facilitate the visit of the committee’s chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), to the White House grounds last week to view classified intelligence documents. “What he did, what he saw, who he met with was 100 percent proper,” Spicer said of Nunes. The chairman later briefed the president on the information and declared publicly that the documents showed Trump campaign aides were swept up in U.S. intelligence surveillance of foreign nationals. That prompted the president to say he felt “somewhat” vindicated in his unsubstantiated allegations that President Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap on him. View Graphic Team Trump’s ties to Russian interests Trump, meanwhile, weighed in again Friday via Twitter by suggesting that he supported a request by his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, for immunity from prosecution in exchange for offering to testify in the probe. “This is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems,” Trump wrote. Spicer said the White House was not concerned that Flynn might reveal damaging information, even though Trump fired him in February over revelations Flynn misled senior officials, including Vice President Pence, over his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. But Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, called it a “grave and momentous step” for a national security official to seek immunity. Schiff said the investigation “grows in severity and magnitude by the day,” and he said the committee has “much work and many more witnesses and documents” to review before any witness can be considered for immunity. For the White House, it was another chaotic day in which its attempt to regain control of the political conversation — this time through two executive orders on trade — was relegated to an afterthought in Washington. Trump aides have expressed growing frustration at their inability to gain control of Washington’s narrative, just over two months into the president’s tenure. And amid mounting attention on Trump’s frequent weekend jaunts to his winter retreat in Palm Beach, Fla., and attendant golf-course outings, aides said the president would remain in Washington this weekend holding meetings at the White House. Flynn is asking for immunity. Here's what he said about that before.

Here's what he and President Donald Trump said about immunity in 2016. Here's what former national security adviser Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump said about immunity in 2016. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Trump has a lot to prepare for, with three world leaders — Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, King Abdullah II of Jordan and Chinese President Xi Jinping — due to meet with the president next week. In many ways, the first weeks of the Trump White House have resembled a chaotic tech start-up. Inside the West Wing, according to White House officials, each new crisis and mishap, including the botched rollout of the president’s travel ban and the failure on the GOP health-care bill, has been viewed as a learning opportunity, to better understand what works and what doesn’t, as well as which staffers can perform under pressure — and, perhaps more importantly, which can’t. On Thursday, the administration announced its first major staff adjustment, with Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh leaving to oversee an outside political group that supports the president’s agenda. The official explanation was that after the health-care bill’s collapse, Walsh realized she could be of more value to the White House from the outside, helping guide a pro-Trump group that has provided almost no air cover for the president or his agenda. But Walsh, one of the few top women in the West Wing, was never a likely fit in the Trump administration. A longtime confidante of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who had served as the Republican National Committee chairman, Walsh viewed Trump with skepticism throughout much of the campaign. And, in return, she was treated with suspicion by Trump loyalists who distrusted her background in mainstream Republican Party politics and thought she leaked information to the press, according to several administration officials. The White House took the unusual move of having several aides gather a small group of reporters to insist, on background, that Walsh was not being fired and was simply leaving on her own accord. By Thursday, senior aides were trying to beat back vaguely sourced reports on social media that Rick Dearborn, a deputy chief of staff who oversees legislative affairs, might also be on his way out. David Urban — who served as chief of staff to Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and helped run Trump’s campaign team in that state — was cited as a possible replacement. Urban’s name is often mentioned during times of turmoil, and he was previously floated as a possible replacement for Priebus. Three White House officials insisted that Dearborn’s job was safe, and Cliff Sims, a Trump communications aide, lashed out at reporters on Twitter. “Get a grip . . . And better ‘sources,’ ” Sims wrote. But it was the Russia probe that continued to dominate the conversation in Washington, forcing the White House into a reactive posture for another day. politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Politics newsletter The big stories and commentary shaping the day.

See all newsletters As the disclosures have mounted over communications between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials during the campaign and transition, the White House has sought to distance itself from the conduct of some members of the president’s campaign team. But the revelations that three senior White House aides, including the top lawyer for the National Security Council, were involved in the handling of the files that were shared with Nunes has raised new questions about the conduct of the president’s staff. “It’s shocking,” said Michael McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. “I used to work at the White House. I used to work at the NSC. . . . I never, ever briefed a U.S. congressman on anything in that capacity, and I’m not aware of anyone who did when I was there.” Spicer dismissed suggestions that Nunes was granted carte blanche access to the White House’s 18-acre grounds, which includes the NSC headquarters in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door. “Yes, it is appropriate for a member of Congress to contact someone who contacted him,” Spicer said, referring to reports that Nunes had chosen to meet his source for the information at the White House to view the documents in a secure location. “As Chairman Nunes said himself, he was not hiding or roaming. He was asked to come over here by an individual. He came over, which happens daily.”",

      "text" : "Political commentator and author Ann Coulter speaks onstage at The Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe at Sony Studios on Aug. 27, 2016 in Los Angeles. The University of California at Berkeley has canceled a speech Coulter was to give later this month amid fears of violence. (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images) After riots and violent protests in and around their campus during the past three months, officials at the University of California at Berkeley said Wednesday that the school is canceling a planned speech by conservative firebrand Ann Coulter because of safety concerns. In a letter to a campus Republican group that invited Coulter to speak, university officials said that they made the decision to cancel Coulter’s appearance after assessing the violence that flared on campus in February, when the same college Republican group invited right-wing provocateur and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos to speak. The violence and protests caused by Yiannopoulos’s invitation garnered national attention and forced officials to put the campus on lockdown. And after the university canceled the Yiannopoulos’s talk, President Trump criticized the school and threatened in a tweet to pull federal funds from UC-Berkeley. If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view – NO FEDERAL FUNDS? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 The decisions by UC-Berkeley to cancel both events involving high-profile Republicans are especially notable given the campus’s role during the 1960s and 1970s as the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement and its long tradition of social protest. Coulter said in an email to The Washington Post on Wednesday that the university had been trying to force her to cancel her speech by “imposing ridiculous demands” on her but that she still agreed “to all of their silly requirements.” She said that she believes her speech “has been unconstitutionally banned” by the “public, taxpayer-supported UC-Berkeley.” Coulter said the university insisted that her speech take place in the middle of the day, that only students could attend, and that the exact venue wouldn’t be announced until the last minute. She said that she agreed with the conditions, but that apparently wasn’t good enough. “They just up and announced that I was prohibited from speaking anyway,” Coulter said, noting that her speech topic was to be immigration, the subject of one of her books. “I feel like the Constitution is important and that taxpayer-supported universities should not be using public funds to violate American citizens’ constitutional rights.” A conservative national group that was helping to organize the event, Young America’s Foundation, said Coulter also made demands of her own, including that any students engaging in violence be expelled. In her email, Coulter said she is still planning to give her speech, and YAF spokesman Spencer Brown said she has told them she plans to appear at Berkeley on April 27. “If Berkley wants to have free speech, they are going to get it,” Brown said. A university spokesman said the school has not been in direct contact with Coulter but conveyed its concerns with the student group that invited her. He said the university was especially concerned that holding the event in the late afternoon would risk protests and potential violence stretching into the evening when the area would get crowded with commuters and students. “Everything we’re doing is so the speaker and students can actually exercise their rights without disruption,” Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said. “It’s unfortunate that there are people who think the university’s efforts to keep students and the speaker herself safe are ‘silly.’” On Wednesday, university officials said they hope to reschedule Coulter’s event for sometime in September, and they emphasized that they are not canceling her event because of her controversial nature or sharply conservative views. “It has nothing to do with anyone’s political views. We believe in unqualified support to the First Amendment. But we also have an unqualified focus on safety of our students,” Mogulof said. “We are going to be making a concerted effort to explain the reasons behind this.” On Saturday, protests again turned violent — though in the city of Berkeley, not the university campus — as pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters clashed in the streets. The violence on Saturday was further heightened later in the day as far-left activists and far-right activists joined the fray. And on Tuesday at Auburn University in Alabama, three people were arrested amid protests and a fistfight that occurred over a speech by self-proclaimed white nationalist leader Richard Spencer. At Berkeley, university officials said the recent violence has caused them to rethink where and when to hold such events. In their letter, university officials also partly blamed the college Republican group for inviting Coulter and setting a date for the event — April 27 — without consulting the university. Officials learned of Coulter’s event, the letter said, from reading about it in newspapers. And after consulting with university police, officials said, they could not find a venue available on that date that would allow them to protect Coulter, the audience and bystanders.",

      "text" : "Viareggio, Italy (CNN)The maiden voyage of the Aurora -- a new 160-foot, $26.6 million aluminum super yacht launched last week in Viareggio, Italy -- lasted less than one hour and only covered a humble 500 yards. It also took place entirely on land, when all 320 tons of the boat were loaded atop heavy duty, remote-controlled dollies and carefully rolled from the shed where it was constructed to the edge of the Mediterranean. Watching an imposing vessel like the Aurora passing through the darkened streets of the scruffy, seaside town, halting traffic and only narrowly avoiding a collision with a streetlight, induces a surreal and somewhat disorienting feeling. But for those more immersed in the world of bespoke luxury yachts, surreal is perhaps the norm.The maiden voyage of the Aurora took place entirely on land, when it was rolled from the shed where it was constructed to the edge of the Mediterranean.\"Viareggio is famous for this reason,\" says Federico Rossi, COO of Rossinavi, the family-owned and operated company that built the Aurora. \"Our tradition is to see vessels that go around in the city during the night.\"Damien Hirst stages comeback with monumental sunken 'treasures' Young millennial buyersRead MoreWhat isn't tradition is the age of the Aurora buyer; the latest entry into the rarefied world of super yacht ownership -- who, although present for the unveiling where he mingled with guests, wishes to remain anonymous -- is only 30 years old.\"Generally, the customer is 55 to 70,\" Frederico, himself only 39, explains. The Rossi family takes pride in satisfying all customers, 25 years outside of the usual age range or not.In spending power, the buyer of the Aurora -- who is from Switzerland -- fits the profile of the typical Rossinavi client. His age is the most noticeable exception and also marks a potential turning point for the company.Research conducted by Rossinavi suggests that the average yacht owner is getting younger; they believe it may shift in the next 20 years to include more buyers in their 30s. Rossinavi COO Federico Rossi and Architect and interior designer Achille Salvagni survey the Aurora; interior elements will be put in place once the ship is in the water.Last year, the company partnered with the International University of Monaco to research what yachts for millennials could look like, focusing on environmental impact, implementation of new technology, safety concerns and updated aesthetics. While acknowledging that super yachts for millennials is a niche corner of an already niche industry, Federico is enthusiastic about what tapping that market could mean for Rossinavi. \"Yachts are a conservative business. People generally want the same boat: classic,\" he says. \"Millennials are used to going outside the general boundaries. For us, it's a great opportunity -- shipyards that can take this [demographic] into consideration are only shipyards that build full custom ships.\"Luxury redefined in 8 new objects Family heritage The Aurora is the second of three extravagant super yachts set to be delivered this year to clients of Rossinavi. The shipyard has roots dating to 1980, when brothers Claudio and Paride Rossi worked as subcontractors, assembling passenger ships on behalf of other builders in a previous incarnation of their business operating under the name Fratelli Rossi. In 2007, they began to take commissions from their own clients. Save for some interior design pieces and the occasional element co-designed and co-engineered with companies like Rolls Royce, Rossinavi luxury pleasure boats are made entirely in-house. Fixtures are often fashioned from a single piece of aluminum or steel -- \"like Michelangelo,\" as one craftsman in the company's workshop describes it.A Rossinavi yacht under construction in the Rossinavi shipyard in Viareggio highlights the company's expertise working with steel and aluminum.Claudio serves as co-owner and CEO of the rechristened Rossinavi brand. Paride is still a co-owner, as well as working alongside a handful of his siblings, nieces, and nephews enlisted to keep the enterprise humming. As COO since 2010, Federico -- Claudio's son -- also functions as the face of the company. The creation of each bespoke ship takes between two and three years to complete and passes through several pairs of Rossi hands working in tandem before it's finally delivered to the client. \"We are really close,\" Federico says. \"It's a good family.\" The crowd at the Aurora's unveiling is a mix of friends of the owner, Rossinavi employees and their families, and locals from Viareggio.Typically, the process begins when prospective buyers approach Rossinavi with an idea of the size and type of ship they want. Rossinavi enlists a naval architect outside the company to collaborate on ensuring the vessel can meet technical requirements like speed, range, and propulsion, as determined by the client's preference. Understanding Japan's unique 'scrap and build' design culture(Almost) anything is fair game Exterior and interior designers come in next. Sometimes the same person or firm handles both duties, and most often they are selected from a pool of frequent collaborators, like Fulvio de Simoni, Tommaso Spadolini or Venice's Team for Design. \"If the client says 'I have my own designer for the interiors,' we accept it,\" concedes Gabriele Zucconi, Rossinavi's \"historical consultant\" who has known the Rossi family since Claudio was only 15-years-old. \"[But], I will say, we are not very happy about it.\"Once the plans are finalized and a fee negotiated (plans for the Aurora took four months to finalize) construction begins at one of Rossinavi's waterfront properties in Viareggio or their work site in nearby Pisa. Achille Salvagni, the Rome-based architect and interior designer who has worked on three Rossinavi super yachts, including the Aurora, says the Rossi's status as Italy's only family-owned and operated super yacht shipyard separates it from the pack. A Rossinavi employee touches up the Aurora's paint job the morning of the unveiling.\"From a screw up to the hull, they are capable to make a telephone call and go directly to the right source to get it ready,\" he explains. \"You have a family that never says no to any single problem.\"Federico can think of only one instance in which he will turn a client down outright. \"When they ask me for a Spartan boat,\" he says. \"I'm afraid the market recognizes a Spartan boat as a cheap boat. We prefer to maintain our target, and we say, 'no, this is not possible.'\"Otherwise, anything is fair game -- and Rossinavi clients come to play. Given a price tag that can run from $26.6 million to $53.2 million, coupled with yearly maintenance expenditures that the company estimates to be approximately 10% of the sales price, Federico explains that most Rossinavi clients need to have at least $106.5 million in liquid assets in the bank. The cost of repainting the entirety of a 230-foot boat for instance, can easily run upward of $4.26 million when manpower is figured into the total. \"A guy who can buy a multimillion euro toy is supposed to be somebody who knows his business and who knows how to run it,\" Zucconi says. After a blessing from a local priest, new yachts are christened with the traditional shattering of a bottle of champagne against the hull.\"Generally speaking, you are dealing with successful people (who are) conscious of being successful.\" Zucconi describes a client who paid $127,732 to buy and install a 103-inch Sony plasma TV on board his yacht, then threw in an additional $120,000 to include a secondhand Steinway piano. \"When I tell you that we are speaking toys, they are really toys,\" he says.Not that Rossinavi is in danger of running out of potential clients eager to pick up an expensive hobby. The company has received commissions from Luca Barilla, a repeat Rossinavi customer who sits atop the Barilla pasta empire; Mario Sbarro, of Sbarro pizzeria fame; Italian shipping magnates; and an international assortment of businessmen from Russia, India, and Germany.From glass palaces to dizzying towers: How tech revolutionizes architectureThe next one is the best one Aside from courting a younger clientele, Rossinavi is also in the process of building an \"ice class\" ship, designed to perform in both Caribbean and Arctic waters, more vessels that push 230 feet in length, and others with the capability to traverse the Pacific and the Atlantic. Federico says none of these technical achievements will come at the expense of the level of comfort owners and their passengers request from Rossinavi. But they might have them coming back for more. \"Luxury for us is to have the shipyard at the disposal of the client,\" he says. \"The next one is the best one, he adds.",

      "text" : "Several Democrats are considering challenging Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) next year, setting up a potential primary in a northern Virginia district that has been in Republican hands since the early 1980s. The enthusiasm among Democrats in Comstock’s district reflects a trend playing out around the country as liberal activists who want to combat President Trump’s agenda turn to public office. Comstock isn’t up for re-election until 2018, but candidates are already busy gaming out the race and lining up support in a district where experts say an off-year election requires a war chest of at least $3 million. Many Democrats say the most formidable candidate of the bunch would be state Sen. Jennifer Wexton, 48, an attorney from Loudoun County, who confirmed to The Washington Post that she is weighing a run, but declined further comment. Kimberly Adams, 41, the past president of the Fairfax teachers union, already announced her candidacy, has a web site and is raising money. Dorothy McAuliffe, 53, the wife of Gov. Terry McAuliffe, is considering joining the crowded field as well, according to two Democrats familiar with her thinking. Also thinking about jumping into the race are Lindsey Davis Stover, 38, a communications strategist from McLean who served as a senior advisor to the secretary for Veterans Affairs in the Obama administration, Daniel Helmer, 35, an Army veteran and Rhodes Scholar from Fairfax County and Jimmy Bierman, an 31-year-old attorney from McLean. [In northern Virginia, GOP congresswoman fights the Trump factor] For years, Democrats have nursed hopes of winning the district, which stretches from the Washington suburbs to rural counties along the West Virginia border. Former congressman Frank Wolf’s 34-year hold on the seat kept it out of reach for Democrats for three decades. His protegee, Comstock, is trying to follow his lead. She out-performed Trump, who lost the state to Hillary Clinton, by 16 points to a win a second term last year. But Democrats say that Trump’s bumpy young presidency has energized many and that any candidate who can tap into anti-Trump sentiment and focus on the right mix of national and local issues would have a chance. “Districts like VA10 are really ones that represent the path back to the majority for Democrats,” said Kyle Kondik, who analyzes House elections at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Comstock, a former Republican operative, will be ready for the fight. In an eight-year period, she won three competitive races at the state level and two for Congress. “Democrats have spent over $20 million trying to defeat her and they have a 0-5 record to show for it because these failed campaigns are dictated by partisan operatives from outside the district who continuously underestimate Congresswoman Comstock’s record of legislative accomplishment, her hard work ethic, and her constant presence and connection with her constituents,” her political director, Ken Nunnenkamp, said in a statement. Outside groups spent nearly $15 million on the 2016 contest between Comstock and LuAnn Bennett, a real estate developer from McLean, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks donations. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee — which named Comstock’s seat one of its top mid-term targets — and Emily’s List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, are quietly conferring with potential challengers. Democratic Reps. Bobby Scott, Gerry Connolly, Don Beyer and Donald McEachin have also been meeting with them, as has former congressman Jim Moran. Bennett, who lost to Comstock by six points, has notruled out running again, but said she is not considering it at the moment. “I am encouraged that so many people are willing to step up,” she said. “If my campaign demonstrated anything it was that Comstock is vulnerable. She can be beat.” [Activists plan to hold town hall in Rep. Comstock’s Northern Virginia district — with or without her] Democrats and liberal activists tracking Comstock since the election are unhappy with her practice of holding meetings with small groups of constituents and keeping them secret until they are over. She has declined to hold a town hall meeting, prompting one group to hold its own without her. The activists behind the website DumpComstock.com raised money for a billboard they plan to erect on Monday in the western end of the district admonishing Comstock to “Do your job. Hold a town hall,” and have posted videos of the congresswoman avoiding questions. “Anger and frustration can be a great motivator,” Kondik said, explaining why several people are considering a run against Comstock. Fairfax County Supervisor Kathy L. Smith issued a statement last month urging Comstock to vote against the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. That sparked speculation among some, including the liberal blog Blue Virginia, that Smith is also weighing a run. Through her chief of staff, Smith declined comment. Comstock said she would have voted “no,” but the bill was pulled from the floor. Patsy Brown, who chairs the Democratic Party committee in the congressional district, said the field is in flux. The committee will decide on the method of nomination — a state-run primary or a party-run caucus — early next year. “At least 13 people have contacted me,” she said. “Two have since pulled out. I have met personally with 10 of them and I have meeting number 11 set up for later this week... At this stage of the game, it’s wide open.” Helmer, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and Rhodes Scholar, said the election inspired him. “In the wake of the election I realized there’s a need for a re-dedication to our values,” he said. “Trump’s election is part of it, but there’s a real hunger for a government that works, a Congress that moves beyond sound bites.” Lindsey Davis Stover was chief of staff to Rep. Chet Edwards (D-Texas), who lost reelection in 2010. She worked for the Obama administration for about two years and then founded a communications firm that specializes in veterans and defense issues. local virginia-politics Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Local Headlines newsletter Daily headlines about the Washington region.

See all newsletters “It’s a time when courage is needed to stand up to Donald Trump and the values we hold dear,” she said. “There’s an energy right now in the district that is like nothing we’ve ever seen before.” Privately, Democrats say Wexton, the state senator, would have an early leg up because she is a current office holder and former prosecutor with roots in Loudoun County, the heart of the district and where Trump lost by 16 points. “Her ability to fight back is something that’s needed when you face Comstock because Comstock has no relationship with the truth,” said Del. Kathleen Murphy, who lost a 2013 House of Delegates race to Comstock. “And you need to be able to counter the things that she says with facts, the real facts.” Asked about Murphy's comments, Nunnenkamp, Comstock’s political director, said Democrats who took her advice have not been able to unseat the congresswoman. “Those failed campaigns have also had one thing in common – the bitter partisan advice of Kathleen Murphy, whose paltry record of passing legislation, pales in comparison to that of Rep. Comstock,” he said.",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-he-offered-china-better-trade-terms-in-exchange-for-help-on-north-korea-1492027556WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump said Wednesday he has offered President Xi Jinping more favorable trade terms for Beijing in exchange for help on confronting the threat of North Korea, raising the prospect of a new pact that does less than Mr. Trump would otherwise like to address the U.S. trade deficit with China.Mr. Trump, in a wide-ranging interview with The Wall Street Journal, said he told Mr. Xi when they met for the first time last week that his administration wouldn’t accept a continued large trade deficit with China. He added that he told Mr. Xi: “‘But you want to make a great deal? Solve the problem in North Korea.’ That’s worth having deficits. And that’s worth having not as good a trade deal as I would normally be able to make.”Mr. Trump also said his administration won’t label China a currency manipulator in a report due this week, despite a promise he made on the campaign trail to do so. He said that China has stopped manipulating its currency, and that it was more important to focus on cooperation with Beijing on North Korea.As he nears the 100-day mark of his time in the White House, with crises in North Korea and Syria, deeply strained relations with Russia and his legislative agenda stalled at home, Mr. Trump discussed an array of issues facing his presidency during a 70-minute Oval Office interview.A week after he ordered the first American airstrikes against Syria’s regime in response to its chemical weapons attack that killed at least 85 people, Mr. Trump said his administration’s policy is not to demand that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad step down as part of a peaceful resolution to the conflict.“Are we insisting on it? No. But I do think it’s going to happen at a certain point,” Mr. Trump said. His comments contrasted with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s position during a Wednesday visit to Moscow that Mr. Assad can’t be part of a long-term government in Syria and could eventually be tried for war crimes.Mr. Trump said he is seeking a vote on new health-care legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act before he puts forward any proposals to overhaul the tax code, though his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, in a separate interview Wednesday, said the two issues were proceeding simultaneously.The president also said in the interview that the dollar “is getting too strong,” which will eventually hurt U.S. businesses and manufacturers. He left open the possibility of renominating Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen once her tenure is up next year, a departure from his campaign pledge.And, in another reversal from his campaign positions, Mr. Trump said that he supports the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which he said helps small companies. He said he plans to fill two vacancies on the bank’s board, which has been effectively paralyzed by three open seats.Mr. Trump spoke to the Journal just before a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, after which he said he no longer believes the alliance is obsolete, as he had maintained previously. Capital Journal is WSJ.com’s home for politics, policy and national security news.Asked how he has changed since taking office, the former businessman—who as a candidate touted his ability to cut deals—said: “The magnitude of everything is so big, and also the decisions are so big. You know, you’re talking about life and death. You’re not talking about ‘you’re going to make a good deal.’”Amid growing U.S. unease about North Korea’s nuclear activities, Mr. Trump dispatched an aircraft carrier group toward the Korean Peninsula over the weekend.Mr. Trump said the ships are meant to deter North Korea from taking further actions. Mr. Trump, who has criticized China for not using its influence with Pyongyang more aggressively, said that during an hourlong phone call with Mr. Xi on Tuesday, he told him he should let North Korean leader Kim Jong Un know the U.S. doesn’t just have aircraft carriers, but also nuclear submarines.“You cannot allow a country like that to have nuclear power, nuclear weapons,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s mass destruction. He doesn’t have the delivery systems yet, but he will.”He said they also discussed China turning away North Korea coal shipments.Earlier in the day, China described the call somewhat differently and didn’t link trade and North Korea as issues. The foreign ministry said Mr. Xi noted that both sides had numerous mechanisms in place for high-level dialogue and mentioned the two sides’ agreement on a “100-day action plan” on trade, which previous official Chinese accounts had ignored.Mr. Trump said it isn’t impossible to imagine a peaceful Syria with Mr. Assad still in power—unlike his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley. “I think it’s hard to imagine. I wouldn’t use the word impossible,” Mr. Trump said. “I think the word impossible is not right. But it does seem like you certainly wouldn’t be off to a good start,” he said.Mr. Trump said Mr. Assad’s use of chemical weapons again would elicit another military response from him, and he didn’t rule out taking action in response to his use of barrel bombs. But he said he would not intervene in depth in the Syrian conflict, which he said would take resources away from tackling his domestic agenda, such as trying to rebuild U.S. infrastructure.“We have other fights that are fights that are more important as far as our nation’s concerned,” Mr. Trump said. “We don’t need that quicksand.”Mr. Trump said his administration hasn’t yet determined whether Russia knew in advance that the Assad regime planned to launch the chemical weapons attack that U.S. officials have said was sarin gas. “A lot of people would assume yes because they are there,” he said of Russian military forces.While the images of the attack prompted Mr. Trump to order airstrikes in Syria last week, he said it hasn’t changed his mind about banning Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. He said the U.S. should focus on addressing problems at home and suggested the Persian Gulf states step in, possibly by building safe zones in Syria.“We have so many problems that we just can’t be in the business of that,” Mr. Trump said of bringing refugees to the U.S. “When I look at the Gulf states, they have tremendous amounts of money. They’re not putting up very much money.”Mr. Trump described his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin as nonexistent, but said he developed a warm rapport with Mr. Xi after their first meeting last week at his estate in south Florida.He said they hit it off during their first discussion. Mr. Trump said he told his Chinese counterpart he believed Beijing could easily take care of the North Korea threat. Mr. Xi then explained the history of China and Korea, Mr. Trump said.“After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,” Mr. Trump recounted. “I felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power” over North Korea,” he said. “But it’s not what you would think.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that at the Mar-a-Lago summit, both presidents had agreed to keep in closer touch through phone calls and meetings.

      "text" : "Election junkies, rejoice! The biggest race since the 2016 presidential election is here.Georgians in the Atlanta suburbs are casting ballots today in a special election to decide who will represent the state’s 6th Congressional District. Democrats are coming off of strong performances in special House elections in California and Kansas1In both districts, Democratic candidates did better than expected given the past presidential vote. The Republican candidate was defeated in California but won in Kansas. and are hoping to flip Georgia 6, which President Trump carried by only 1 percentage point in 2016. The race is an early test of whether Democrats can ride a wave of anti-Trump sentiment to win traditionally red seats. But figuring out what the test results mean for the national political environment will be … tricky. So here’s everything you need to know about today’s race.\n1. The history\nExactly how red Georgia 6 is matters, both for forecasting who will win and for interpreting what the results of the special election mean. Yes, Trump barely squeaked by Hillary Clinton there, but most other Republican candidates — presidential and House — have done much better. Tom Price, who represented the district in Congress until he resigned to become Trump’s secretary of health and human services, carried it by 23 percentage points in 2016. Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama there by the same margin in 2012. We know from past House elections that our best bet for measuring the political lean of a district is a weighted average22016 is weighted to 75 percent, while 2012 is weighted to 25 percent. of the last two presidential elections, with the most recent election weighted a bit more. By this weighted average, Georgia 6 is about 9.5 percentage points more Republican than the nation as a whole. (That is, if there were a tie in the national popular vote, a Republican would be expected to win Georgia 6 by 9.5 points.) According to this measure, 47 Republican-held House seats are more Democratic-leaning than Georgia 6 is. Democrats need to pick up only 24 seats to win back the House, so even though this is the type of seat that Democrats probably want to be competitive in, taking Georgia 6 is not a necessity for taking back the House.\n2. The candidates and rules\nToday’s primary pits all candidates, regardless of party affiliation, against one another. If no one gets more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters (again, regardless of party) will meet in a runoff on June 20. Eleven Republicans and five Democrats are running in the primary. Local Democratic officials and the liberal blogosphere quickly rallied around Jon Ossoff, a former congressional staffer. He has raised over $8 million and is expected to get almost all the Democratic votes. Republicans, on the other hand, are divided. Although former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel is in second place in most polls, she has averaged just 16 percent over the last nine polls (i.e., those taken within three weeks of the primary). Businessman Bob Gray and former state Sens. Judson Hill and Dan Moody — all Republicans — are not too far behind.\n3. The polls\nIn the last nine polls taken, Ossoff is averaging 42 percent of the vote. And even if undecided voters are allocated proportionally among the candidates based on the percentage of the vote each has now, Ossoff only gets to 46 percent — short of a majority. POLL START\nPOLLSTER\nWITHOUT UNDECIDEDS\nWITH UNDECIDEDS* April 14\nClout Research\n41%\n42% April 13\nEmerson College\n43\n44 April 13\nOpinion Savvy\n42\n43 April 12\nLandmark Communications\n45\n48 April 10\nRevily\n45\n48 April 5\nRed Racing Horses\n39\n41 April 4\nMeeting Street\n43\n48 March 27\nSurveyUSA\n43\n46 March 26\nLake Research Partners\n40\n49 Average 42\n46 Polls show Ossoff is just short of a majority *Undecideds allocated proportionally based on polled vote share of non-undecided respondents. Numbers are rounded. That said, special election polls (like all polls) are inexact. We collected 54 polls from special House elections that have taken place since 2004 and for each compared the leading candidate’s share in the poll with the final election results, taking into account undecideds. We found the true margin of error to be about +/- 8.5 percentage points. That’s almost double the theoretical margin of error posted for most of the polls conducted for the Georgia 6 special election. Even if we compare the average polling share that the leading candidate received in the 22 races that these 54 polls were taken in, the margin of error is still about +/- 7.5 points.\nSo Ossoff winning outright tonight isn’t out of the question. The average of polls is consistent with Ossoff getting between 38 percent and 54 percent. That may seem like a wide range, but polling for House races is in general less accurate than it is for higher-ballot races, and special elections in particular are difficult to poll because turnout is unpredictable.\n4. The early vote\nPolls show Ossoff doing about 10 to 20 percentage points better among early voters than he’ll do overall. That makes sense: Republicans are choosing between many viable candidates and therefore may need more time — perhaps until election day — to determine who they’ll cast a ballot for, while Democratic-leaning voters have long had a favorite. But that’ll make following the returns tonight a bit tricky. Don’t be fooled by early results that show Ossoff with more than 50 percent — the early vote is usually reported first. To win an outright majority and avoid a runoff, Ossoff probably wants to be well above 60 percent among early voters.\n5. The demographics\nGeorgia’s 6th District is made up of parts of three counties — Cobb, DeKalb and Fulton — and those parts differ significantly from one another. The Cobb section of Georgia 6 has the largest share of white voters (at 76 percent) and is the most Republican; Trump carried that part of Cobb by 15 points. The DeKalb section of Georgia 6 has the largest share of black voters (at 16 percent) and is the most Democratic; Clinton won it by 19 points. Fulton provided about half the district’s vote in the 2016 presidential election, and the registered voters in the Fulton portion of Georgia 6 are 64 percent white and 12 percent black. Trump won the 6th District’s section of Fulton by 3 points.\n6. The benchmarks\nIf you want a sense of how Ossoff is doing as the returns come in tonight, you can use past presidential results as a rough benchmark. If he’s beating the vote share for each county that is shown in the last column of the table below, Ossoff should be on track to win a majority (and avoid a runoff): VOTED FOR COUNTY\nSHARE OF DISTRICT VOTES (2016)\nOBAMA (2012)\nCLINTON (2016)\nWEIGHTED AVERAGE\nOSSOFF BENCHMARK Cobb\n30%\n32%\n40%\n38%\n43 DeKalb\n22\n47\n57\n55\n60 Fulton\n48\n37\n46\n44\n49 How much Ossoff needs to win, by county, to avoid a runoff The Ossoff benchmark is based on a uniform swing of 5.5 percentage points, applied to the weighted average.\nSource: Daily Kos Elections To estimate those numbers, we return to the weighted average vote share that Democratic presidential candidates have received over the last two cycles — 44.5 percent of the district-wide vote.3Again, 2016 is weighted to 75 percent, while 2012 is weighted to 25 percent. To get to 50 percent and avoid a runoff, therefore, Ossoff would need to bring in an additional 5.5 percentage points districtwide. The table above simply adds those points to the weighted average in each county in the district.4Applying a uniform shift. For example, in the DeKalb portion of the district, the weighted average of Clinton’s and Obama’s vote shares is about 55 percent; when a uniform swing of 5.5 points is applied, we find that Ossoff would need upwards of 60 percent there.\nIf the county-level isn’t small enough for you, we’ve also calculated what share Ossoff might need to win a majority by voting precinct. County benchmarks can be helpful, but county-level returns can be misleading depending on which precincts have reported and which haven’t. You can track the precinct benchmarks here. This way, you’ll be able to tell if the returns you are seeing in Fulton are from a heavily Republican precinct like Roswell precinct 9 (RW09) or a heavily Democratic one like Sandy Springs precinct 15A (SS15A).\n7. What’s next?\nIf there’s no outright winner at the end of this first round of voting and Ossoff moves on to face a Republican in the runoff, be careful about using tonight’s results to forecast Round 2. The dynamics in the runoff will be completely different; whichever Republican comes in second, for example, will be able to turn their fire on Ossoff instead of fighting other Republicans. As my colleague Nate Silver wrote on Monday:\nEven if Ossoff finishes in the low 40s, it will be hard to rule him out in the second round provided that he still finishes in first place by a comfortable margin. But even if Ossoff finishes just a point or two shy of 50 percent, and Democrats finish with more votes than Republicans overall, he won’t have any guarantees in the runoff …\nPolling and history both suggest that Ossoff would likely be about a 50-50 bet in Round 2.\nEnjoy!",

      "text" : "ALPHARETTA, Ga. — President Donald Trump on Monday attacked his political enemies seeking an upset in Georgia’s special congressional election, blasting the leading Democratic candidate as a “super liberal” who “wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!” Trump did not expound on his unfounded accusations about 30-year-old Jon Ossoff, but the president’s Twitter broadside a day before the special primary underscores how big a Democratic victory would be nationwide and in Atlanta’s historically conservative northern suburbs. Ossoff, who has used anti-Trump sentiments nationally to collect at least $8.3 million in campaign contributions, countered Monday that Trump is “misinformed,” but added that he’s “glad the president is interested in the race.” Republicans and Democrats alike see the contest as an important barometer of Trump’s standing ahead of 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats will try to regain control of Congress. The Georgia district, represented previously by Trump’s new health secretary, Tom Price, encompasses reliably Republican territory across parts of three metro Atlanta counties. But Trump underperformed here in November, barely edging Democrat Hillary Clinton and falling short of a majority. In 2012, by contrast, Republican nominee Mitt Romney garnered more than 60 percent of the vote. Even the leading Republican candidates concede that Ossoff will lead an 18-candidate “jungle primary” that places all candidates on the same ballot. The question is whether he can win an outright majority. GOP hopeful Karen Handel said Monday that she is confident enough Republicans will cast ballots to hold Ossoff short of a majority, thus setting up a June 20 runoff between the Democratic upstart and Tuesday’s top Republican performer. “Republican voters are not going to sit by and let this district go to a Democrat,” Handel said. But the mere possibility has national observers watching closely, particularly because the district is dominated by the kind of suburban voters Democrats need to have any chance at a House majority. The scrutiny grew even more intense after last week’s special congressional election in Kansas, where Republican Ron Estes won by just single-digits in a Wichita-based district that Trump had carried easily. Ossoff on Monday continued walking a fine line between embracing the national energy and trying to make the contest a purely local one. “This is not about me. This is about us,” he told a few hundred supporters Monday night. “This is about this community. This is about the kind of community we want to live in. The kind of country we believe in.” Ossoff did not mention his exchange with Trump — or call the president by name at all — during his remarks. Handel, a GOP establishment favorite who served previously as Georgia secretary of state, also has worked to localize the race. “My closing argument is the same as my opening argument, that we need an experienced individual with a track record of delivering real results,” she said while campaigning Monday in an upscale shopping district. That has made her an outlier among top Republican contenders. Wealthy technology executive Bob Gray has cozied up to Trump from the start, running ads that show him, literally, draining a swamp — a nod to one of Trump’s campaign signatures. Gray pledges to be a “willing partner” for the new administration. Former state Sen. Judson Hill is touting his endorsement from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, one of a gaggle of Republican presidential hopefuls that Trump vanquished. Hill’s campaign is using Rubio on a recorded phone pitch to Republican households. Ossoff, meanwhile, has tried to capitalize on intense anti-Trump sentiments among liberals, while still coaxing disaffected independents and moderate Republicans who normally wouldn’t consider voting Democratic. Responding to Trump’s tweet, Ossoff said in his statement that he is “focused on bringing fresh leadership, accountability and bipartisan problem solving to Washington.” National Republicans have sought to blunt Ossoff’s momentum by tying him to national Democrats, particularly House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat is an unpopular figure in this Georgia district that once sent former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to Capitol Hill. Still, that message hasn’t come with the same financial muscle as Ossoff’s non-stop television campaign. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a political action committee backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, has plunked more than $2 million into Ossoff attacks, an impressive sum but only about a quarter of the Democrat’s campaign haul. politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Local Politics Alerts Breaking news about local government in D.C., Md., Va.

Almost 55,000 voters cast early ballots, according to the Georgia Secretary of State. Various campaigns say they expect somewhere between 100,000 and 125,000 total votes out of nearly 440,000 registered active voters.

      "text" : "Just days after taking office, President Trump invited American manufacturers to recommend ways the government could cut regulations and make it easier for companies to get their projects approved. Industry leaders responded with scores of suggestions that paint the clearest picture yet of the dramatic steps that Trump officials are likely to take in overhauling federal policies, especially those designed to advance environmental protection and safeguard worker rights. Those clues are embedded in the 168 comments submitted to the government after Trump signed a presidential memorandum Jan. 24 instructing the Commerce Department to figure out how to ease permitting and trim regulations with the aim of boosting domestic manufacturing. The Environmental Protection Agency has emerged as the primary target in these comments, accounting for nearly half, with the Labor Department in second place as the subject of more than one-fifth, according to a Commerce Department analysis. Among the notable items on industry’s to-do list: ●BP wants to make it easier to drill for oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico by reducing how often companies must renew their leases. ●A trade association representing the pavement industry wants to preclude the U.S. Geological Survey from conducting what the group says is “advocacy research” into the environmental impact of coal tar. The Pavement Coatings Technology Council says this research could limit what it uses to seal parking lots and driveways. ●The U.S. Chamber of Commerce wants to reduce the amount of time opponents have to challenge federal approval of projects. Challenges would have to be filed within two years, down from six. ●The Chamber also wants to jettison a requirement that employers report their injury and illness records electronically to the Labor Department so they can be posted “on the internet for anyone to see.” ●And in its 51-page comment, “Make Federal Agencies Responsible Again,” the Associated General Contractors of America recommended repealing 11 of President Barack Obama’s executive orders and memorandums, including one establishing paid sick leave for government contractors. Three senior administration officials in different departments said the White House is inclined to accept many of these suggestions. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a process that is underway. Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s senior vice president, said in an interview that the EPA has led the government in issuing “high-cost, high-impact regulations” that harmed businesses. The Chamber estimated that rules issued under Obama would cost businesses more than $70 billion annually. “Now we have an administration who’s interested” in streamlining federal approvals and rules, Bradley said, and is providing relief “from a regulatory onslaught that occurred, principally, during the prior administration.” Former EPA official: Cuts would target most vulnerable communities Embed Copy Share Play Video4:53 (McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) Washington Post reporter Dennis Brady talks with Mustafa Ali, a former EPA environmental justice leader who served more than two decades with the agency, to discuss the consequences of President Trump's budget proposal. Washington Post reporter Dennis Brady talks with Mustafa Ali, a former EPA environmental justice leader who served more than two decades with the agency, to discuss the consequences of President Trump's budget proposal. (McKenna Ewen/The Washington Post) Across the government, administration officials are beginning to flesh out how they can scale back rules imposed by Obama — and, in some cases, his predecessors. Officials are launching websites to take suggestions, holding meetings with chief executives and industry representatives, and drawing up recommendations to submit to the White House. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to submit his report on stimulating domestic manufacturing toward the end of next month. “This is the first time any administration has canvassed the private sector to find the worst regulatory and permitting problems, and it is axiomatic that you can’t solve a problem until you have identified it,” Ross said, adding that officials were “refining their recommendations” now “to take responsible action. We look forward to working further with American workers and businesses, in manufacturing and other sectors, to unshackle the innovative spirit that made this country great.” [Trump undertakes biggest regulatory rollback since Reagan] The National Association of Manufacturers began preparing its response the day Trump signed the memorandum, according to Rosario Palmieri, its vice president for labor, legal and regulatory policy. On March 27, NAM hosted a meeting at its offices in which representatives from about 100 companies discussed their recommendations with senior Commerce staff. “This has a tremendous opportunity to be very successful and result in real burden reductions,” Palmieri said. More than 80 percent of the comments Commerce received on the presidential memorandum came from trade associations or manufacturers. The campaign to roll back regulations has sparked concern among liberal advocacy groups and some former Obama administration officials, who said the federal government must keep long-term consequences in mind as it considers unwinding rules aimed at protecting the environment and workers. “At a time when many CEOs are focused on the short term and looking to maximize their profitability each quarter, I ­believe that a lot of their aversion to these regulations reflects a short-term mind-set that values reducing costs over anything else,” said Jeffrey Zients, who worked on regulatory matters while holding two top economic posts in Obama’s White House. “That’s unfortunate, because well-crafted regulations are an important part of creating sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run.” Marcus Peacock, who served briefly as a senior White House budget adviser under Trump before joining the Business Roundtable advocacy group this month, said previous efforts to streamline regulations “have had difficulty sticking as strongly as they should have.” But several of Trump’s earliest actions could give this latest drive more punch. Trump signed an executive order requiring that many agencies eliminate two regulations for each new one they propose and that these changes entail no increased cost. Another executive order established a regulatory reform officer and task force in each department. Several previous administrations, both Republicans and Democrats, have sought to eliminate regulations that were deemed burdensome. Obama launched a “regulatory lookback” in 2011 that solicited input from the public and saved $13 billion — mostly in paperwork reductions. The Transportation Department, for example, changed a rule requiring truck drivers to file reports on their vehicles every day they hit the road to one mandating reports only when they identify problems or have reason to think there’s an issue with their trucks. But that effort received a tepid response from industry. Some groups, including the Chamber, said the scope was too narrow and that they did not have sufficient time to conduct a full review. In a March 26, 2011, letter, the Chamber wrote the Labor Department that it was given less than a month to submit comments: “This compressed time frame has limited our ability to identify regulations that may deserve attention.” “It’s not like industry sent us a wish list of what it wanted done,” said one former Obama administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly. [At EPA, Trump signs order to unwind Obama’s environmental record] Janet McCabe, who helped craft some of the rules now in jeopardy as head of the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, said her agency had sought comment from across the ideological spectrum. That contrasted with how Trump2’s EPA is seeking public comment, she said. “The signals that they’re sending through the way they describe their initiative is the audience they’re worried about, to the exclusion of everybody else, is industry,” McCabe said. Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said his advocacy organization did not comment and has been struggling to keep up with the “overwhelming, pretty much nonstop assault” on rules put in place under Obama. “The big picture is at every turn, once the transition began, every special interest in the country was signaled, ‘Hey, it’s all you can eat,’ ” Cook said. Several business advocates, for their part, say the shift represents a course correction. The National Association of Roofing Contractors wrote in its submission to Commerce, “For years, the Obama Administration consistently refused to address the many concerns of NRCA members when issuing new regulations.” politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Politics newsletter The big stories and commentary shaping the day. Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Dan Bosch, senior manager of regulatory policy for the National Federation of Independent Business, said his members are still “in limbo” as they wait to see if Trump’s team targets regulations they oppose. NFIB has suggested a raft of changes, including one that would designate the Commerce Department — instead of the State Department — as the agency in charge of approving pipelines and other projects that cross borders. The federation says the lead agency should have “commercial expertise and an interest in encouraging business.” The NFIB has also objected to a policy adopted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration allowing representatives of an outside union to tour a nonunion shop with an OSHA inspector. Bosch said it is an invasion of privacy to have someone who’s not an employee “coming into your business and trying to point out things that, potentially, those employees should mention.” But David Michaels, who headed OSHA under Obama and is now a professor at George Washington University’s School of Public Health, said, “The culture of the trade associations in Washington is to attack any new regulation as burdensome, even though the empirical evidence is that they’re easily met, they’re not burdensome and they save lives.” “But injured workers don’t have a voice in Washington,” he added. “Trade associations do.”",

Just one-fifth said they approve of the job Congress is doing, a drop of 9 points.The findings mark a return to recent norms in views of Congress, after a slight uptick in approval of lawmakers in February. With 20% approving of Congress, its rating is still slightly higher than in most months since May 2011.Mr. Ryan (R., Wis.) is one focus of growing dissatisfaction, with 40% saying they view the House speaker negatively, compared with 22% who had a positive view—an 18-point gap. In February, unfavorable opinions outweighed positive ones by just 1 point.The negative reviews come after a period in which House Republicans tried and failed to pass legislation to repeal most of the Affordable Care Act—a core element of the Republican platform. Mr. Ryan, who became the face of the bill in Congress, was forced to cancel a vote on the legislation after concluding it didn’t have the necessary votes. Talks continue among House Republicans to revive the bill.Mr. Ryan, long considered a rising star in the GOP, saw his ratings drop among Republicans polled. Positive views of the speaker outweighed negative views in the latest survey by 23 points among Republicans—down from 49 points two months ago.A shift among Republicans also helped account for the declining approval of Congress. In the new survey, 58% of Republicans polled disapproved of the job lawmakers are doing, and 31% approved. In February, the share approving and disapproving had been about even.Republicans have stood by President Donald Trump more than they have Mr. Ryan. While Mr. Trump’s job approval declined from February, views among his own party dropped only slightly.Some 39% of adults in the new survey saw Vice President Mike Pence in a negative light, with 38% saying they view him positively. In February, views of the vice president were a net positive, with 42% viewing him favorably and 35% holding a negative opinion.The sharpest drop in support for Mr. Pence came among independents, who viewed the vice president more negatively than positively, by a margin of 14 points in the latest poll. In February, Mr. Pence was above water among independents, with positive views outweighing negative ones by a margin of 7 points. Despite dissatisfaction with the Republican-led Congress, Americans remained relatively split on which party should lead the legislative branch. Some 47% said they would prefer the next election to produce a Democratic-led Congress, while 43% said it should produce a Republican-led Congress.By historical standards, that is a fairly narrow lead for Democrats; big swings toward the Democrats in elections have traditionally been accompanied by a larger lead for the party on this question.The survey found that Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, is viewed favorably by the public, by a slight margin. Some 33% hold a positive view, and 31% an unfavorable view of Ms. Trump, who recently took an official role as assistant to the president. That is largely in line with a Journal/NBC News survey last August, which found 29% with a positive view and 24% with a negative one.The Journal/NBC News poll was based on nationwide telephone interviews with 900 adults from April 17-20. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.27 percentage points, with larger margins of error for subgroups.

      "text" : "So much for predictions: 24 hours after I confidently and publicly predicted the Trump administration was unlikely to strike the Assad regime, they did just that. On balance, I am glad I was wrong: I thought it a mistake not to have struck the Assad regime in 2013, when it first used chemical weapons in a large-scale attack, and I think the benefits of Thursday’s strikes outweigh the costs, even if I wrote in these pages about my real reservations about going down this path. Related Story The U.S. Strikes in Syria We’ll learn much more in the coming days, but here are two quick take-aways from the Trump administration’s decision to strike the Assad regime:The U.S. hand in negotiations over the fate of Bashar al-Assad is now strengthened. The Trump administration—in an about-face that’s left observers with whiplash—is now talking about the need for Bashar al-Assad to go.Good.That was the policy of the Obama administration as well, but poor John Kerry was left to bring that about in the last years of the administration with very few carrots and no sticks at his disposal. President Obama did not want to strike the regime, understandably uneasy about where such strikes might lead and not wanting to take everyone’s eye off the ball with respect to the Islamic State.That did not stop the administration from pursuing quixotic and ultimately humiliating negotiations with the Russians throughout 2016. With the use of force off the table, we were forced to engage with the Russians over the fate of East Aleppo, in particular, as if the Russians were genuine partners for peace and not in fact enabling the very deliberate, brutal regime offensive that brought the last stronghold of the moderate opposition in Syria to its knees. We initially offered up carrots—such as increased military and intelligence cooperation with the Russians against Islamist extremists—if they would help us remove Bashar al-Assad from power, but by the end, we were practically begging the Russians to just let humanitarian aid shipments into East Aleppo. As one of the U.S. negotiators, I found the whole experience degrading.Boy, that’s not the position Rex Tillerson is in now. Secretary Tillerson—who, I hear, has far less patience for the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, than John Kerry did—can now walk into negotiations with everyone at the table understanding this president is willing to use force in a way his predecessor was not. It’s not quite time for Bashar al-Assad to go shopping for dachas in Sochi, but he might want to retain a real estate agent just in case.The fight against the Islamic State just got harder. I had two big fears about striking the Assad regime. The first was that we might inadvertently kill some Russians. The Russian presence in Syria is much more robust than it was in 2013. The Trump administration mitigated that risk by loudly telegraphing its pass in a way that seems to have given the Russians plenty of advance warning.My second fear was that this would greatly complicate the fight against the Islamic State. For the past two years, U.S. and coalition aircraft have flown in and around one of the world’s more robust air defense systems without the Syrian regime harassing the pilots. We had a few incidents where Russian jets got too close to U.S. aircraft or Syrian anti-aircraft radar lit up U.S. or coalition aircraft, but for the most part, the air war has gone forward unimpeded.Both Russia and the Syrian regime, though, are still well-positioned to play the spoiler. They can affect the flights of U.S. aircraft in eastern Syria by activating their air defenses and have, in recent months, brought in more advanced air-defense weaponry that has even the Israelis nervous. They’ve also “accidentally” struck U.S.-backed rebel groups fighting the Islamic State.How will the regime respond? I have no idea. Perhaps, now that they understand force is on the table, they will meekly accept what the United States has just done. Or they can begin to harass coalition pilots or more U.S.-allied rebels. Again, I don’t know. But I do know that America’s coalition partners in Syria and Iraq are all likely much more nervous about what this means for their own forces. Secretary Mattis is going to need to make some calls to soothe some jittery allies. I have a lot of other thoughts and questions about Thursday’s strikes, including wondering how Congress will respond to this action by the executive branch. Ted Cruz’s statement tonight was not exactly a full-throated endorsement, and I suspect libertarians like Rand Paul and critics of the existing legal justifications for the fight against the Islamic State such as Tim Kaine will also criticize the administration. But my final observation concerns my friend Kori Schake, who predicted the administration would strike when I didn’t think it would. The next time Jim Mattis’s intellectual partner tells me something will happen … I’ll listen.Related Video",

Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photo by Thinkstock. requirejs([\"jquery\"], function($) ); Advertisement Q. Runaway friend: Maybe once a month, a group of four to five of my best college girlfriends and significant others will get together and go out to a couple of bars. One of these friends, “Anna,” who is single, has the annoying habit of becoming sulky, then sneaking off without a word to anyone and just never coming back. This happens probably four out of five times we go out. She struggles with depression and doesn’t handle her alcohol particularly well, so I’m fairly sure this stems from the depressant part of the drinking getting to her, and she handles it by leaving. I’m the closest with Anna, so I’ve seen this behavior play out over years, and I’m not particularly sympathetic to it anymore. This combination of circumstances is proving to be problematic: I end up worrying for the rest of the night that she gets home safely because she won’t respond to texts after she’s left; I think it’s downright rude to leave without saying a word; and once others notice she’s gone, I’m always the go-to person for them to ask, “What’s wrong? Is she OK?” and I lose patience with answering and worry it makes me look like a bad friend because I appear unconcerned. Maybe the logical thing to do is to stop inviting her out with us, but she’s very integrated into this group, and often we’re out because we’re celebrating something (birthdays, promotions) and it would seem intentionally mean to leave her out. But I’m so tired of everyone excusing her bad behavior. I understand her needing to go home but think the way she’s going about it is childish and negatively affects the remaining group. What should I do? A: Talk to Anna about this when you two are together, not drinking, and there are no plans to meet up with other friends for a few drinks on the immediate horizon. This is a regular occurrence that clearly distresses both her and you, and tell her you’re concerned about her well-being and worried that she’s not getting the help and support she needs in treating her depression. If she responds well, you two can have a conversation about trying to schedule more events that don’t revolve around drinking and the possibility that it might be best for her to sit out the events that do, at least for a while. If she brushes you off or otherwise makes it clear she’s not interested in discussing the situation, then you’ll have to figure out what you need to do in the future. That might mean taking less responsibility for mediating her relationship to the other friends who ask where she’s gone or not texting her for explanations after she’s left. This is not just a once-in-a-while thing but a regular occurrence, and presumably it’s at least as hard on her as it is on you. If you decide not to invite her to a get-together that you know will involve alcohol, bear in mind that you’re not excluding her to be mean, but declining to participate in a situation that causes distress, fear, and anxiety for all of you. Whatever you do, talk to her about it. Don’t ignore this pattern or just stop inviting her out without notice. You can find other ways to spend time with Anna, both one on one and in group settings, that don’t involve setting the stage for repeat disappearances. Subscribe to Prudie! Q. Love isn’t sex: I have been with my boyfriend for some time now, and we are happy together—friends frequently refer to us as a perfect couple. It’s true, in that he loves me and I love him and can’t imagine my life without him. But I am not attracted to him sexually. I used to fool myself into thinking I was, but I’ve never felt it. We have sex, and I enjoy it, because it’s intimate, and I am glad to make him happy. But I don’t orgasm or enjoy the act itself, and if he said he never wanted to have sex again, I’d be happy to take care of myself in that department and just cuddle with my boyfriend. I’ve never been tempted to cheat, and he is happy with our sex life. But am I being deceitful by pretending to feel what I don’t? I really am in love with him, but sometimes I think he deserves someone who’s more into him sexually. Is it OK to never tell him, if it keeps us both happy? Advertisement A: It isn’t strictly honest, no. If you’re genuinely happy faking enthusiasm during your sexual encounters with him, and can see yourself continuing to do so for the rest of your life, that’s one thing, but if any part of you thinks it’s going to get more and more difficult to keep the act going with the years, I think it’s worth being honest with him now. It sounds like you feel an implicit sense of social pressure from your friends to remain in this “perfect” relationship, and that may be part of what’s keeping you from telling him the truth. If you think he would be pained to learn that your sex life is not in fact mutually enjoyable but merely something you are willing to pretend to like to keep him happy, then you may be right in thinking he deserves someone who is as interested in having sex with him as he is with you. You, too, deserve the space and the freedom to be honest about your sexual desires—whether you ultimately consider yourself to be asexual or something else. I wonder, however, about this part of your letter: “If he said he never wanted to have sex again, I’d be happy to take care of myself in that department.” If your problem is not a lack of interest in sex but the fact that you have not communicated to your boyfriend what works for you sexually, then I think you may have an easier solution to your problem. If you do not enjoy the act itself qua act, that’s one thing, but if you don’t enjoy the act because your boyfriend doesn’t know how to get you off, then you should tell him, and show him, what you want in bed. Q. Re: Runaway friend: Does she do that at gatherings when the significant others aren’t there. You do get together with just the best girlfriends, right? Unless there were several other single friends, I think I’d probably duck out early if I was always stuck being the single with couples. A: That’s worth taking into consideration, although I do think there’s a big difference between “ducking out early” and what Anna is doing. There’s a balance to be struck here between accommodating Anna socially and encouraging her to get help for something that’s clearly distressing her, and I think her friends should pursue both routes. Advertisement Q. Re: Runaway friend: If the friend pursues treatment for her depression, there is a chance she might have to take meds. Antidepressants plus bar-hopping equals a big no-no. A: Thanks for the reminder! Medication may not be something Anna pursues, but if she does, it’s worth remembering it’s not a quick fix, and if part of the problem is her relationship with alcohol, it may have to be addressed separately.

Advertisement Q. Transphobic mom: My mother is 80 years old. I visit her weekly to help out, but she has mobility issues, so she rarely sees anyone other than close family. The other day we were watching TV and Caitlyn Jenner came on. My mom expressed some very intolerant and incorrect views about transgender people—that they’re creeps trying to attack girls in bathrooms, that they’re pretending, and that they’re looking for attention. When I tried to correct her, she waved me off. I’m wondering what the correct course is here. Should I continue to try to educate her, even knowing that she’s held these prejudices for 80 years and is one of the most stubborn people on the planet? Or should I let it go, as she is unlikely to ever meet a transgender person in real life and will probably just push back if I attempt to reason with her? A: I’m generally not of the opinion that prejudiced older folks should be dismissed as being too close to the grave for change, although it’s worth bearing in mind that changes in long-held beliefs will likely be incremental and come slowly rather than overnight, if they come at all. It would be different if your mother’s faculties were limited or if she were no longer able to hold a coherent conversation, but that doesn’t appear to be the case. You did right, I think, in challenging her statements, even if she didn’t change her mind. If such moments come again, consider asking questions that encourage her to check her assumptions: Where has she gotten the idea that girls are being routinely attacked in bathrooms? Why does she think a person would “pretend” to be transgender? What’s wrong with needing attention? You don’t have to turn every visit with your mother into an attempt to change her views, but it’s always worth questioning prejudice when you encounter it, even if you don’t “win.” Q. Bad birthday: My partner and I recently went on a camping trip to celebrate my birthday. My closest friend, who lives near the destination, joined us for one night. This is the first time I have seen her in months and probably the only time I will see her for another several months, since we recently moved to different cities. Our plans were relatively short-notice, but my partner and I tried to play gracious hosts—we brought extra food to prepare meals for them, brought all the required things to have a fire (including an actual fire pit per park regulations), provided them seating after they didn’t bring any despite being asked to, etc. My friend brought her new husband, and this is where our visit goes sour. He got extremely drunk the night they were there. He unpleasantly monopolized the conversation so that I barely got to catch up with my friend, then got into an upsetting argument with her for the remainder of the evening before throwing a fit and literal trash in our campsite and going to bed. The next day, he guilted my friend into leaving way earlier than planned because he wasn’t feeling well enough to explore. In addition, they both seemed oddly ungrateful and impolite in refusing our hospitality despite the remarkable effort my partner made to be accommodating and gracious toward them. I found the whole thing very upsetting and disappointing, especially because I have known this friend for quite a while (and we’ve camped together before), and she has never behaved like this before. It seems like a situation of her giving in to her new husband’s desires instead of standing up for herself, and I find it very troubling. My question is: How should I react? They posted photos from their trip home, which suggest he wasn’t feeling all that bad after all. I don’t want this to strain my friendship, but my feelings are hurt, and I would like her to leave him at home during our future visits. What is an appropriate way to approach this situation? A: Talk to her about her husband’s troubling behavior that night and tell her you’re concerned. This will strain your friendship—already has strained your friendship—so keeping your friendship light and conflict-free is not a reasonable goal in this instance. It’s likely that if you ask her to leave her husband at home for future get-togethers she will decline to attend at all, but it’s worth saying that you’re worried about his controlling and violent behavior (throwing a fit and throwing garbage into a campfire certainly qualifies), that you want to make sure she’s OK, and that you’re here if she ever needs you. Advertisement Q. Am I the crazy one?: I’ve been with my boyfriend, “S,” for nearly two years. We met fairly soon after he lost his wife to cancer. We dated casually at first and then became exclusive eight months later. Not long after that, we began having arguments—big, crying, cruel, three-day-long arguments that led to him threatening to break up over the slightest things. Every time we had one of these, he put it all on me, saying something was wrong with me and I need help. I have always suffered from mild anxiety and depression but have never experienced the level I have since I met him. But I still sought help and was put on some medication. I have noticed an improvement, yet the arguments continue. The problem is that he becomes angry over some “slight,” such as me suggesting his dogs get groomed. He threw a fit because I dared to tell him what to do with “his” dogs. Recently, we were discussing climate change, and all of a sudden he became angry and said I insulted him, but he wouldn’t tell me how. He just proceeded to berate me and insult me for the next 45 minutes until I was a sobbing mess. I finally had to get off the phone to go to work. He then became angry that I didn’t respond to his 100-plus texts and 15-plus phone calls while I was driving to work and at work. His texts became angrier and angrier until he texted, “F--- it, I’m done.” His dog was supposed to go to the vet, and he also stated that I didn’t deserve to care about his dogs or know about the vet appointment or the outcome. Needless to say, I did get mad about that. He then blamed me for not being understanding of his feelings and stress. When I said that I couldn’t be understanding when he’s using my love for the dogs as a weapon, he replied, “You don’t have the brainpower to understand.” I then hung up on him. So my question is this: Am I really the crazy one, or are these signs of emotional abuse? I just cannot understand why he gets so angry and then acts so cruel when he claims to love me. A: This is abuse. You two do not have “big, crying, cruel, three-day-long arguments” because you have mild anxiety and depression but because your boyfriend is abusive. There is no medication you could take, no alteration you could make in your own behavior, that would change this dynamic, because he is abusive and will look for any excuse to explode at you. You could not possibly walk on enough eggshells to keep him from doing this again. The reason you cannot understand his behavior is because you are not an abusive person, and the reason he acts so cruelly when he claims to love you is because he is an abuser who wants to control and humiliate and isolate you, and I am so sorry that he has led you to believe that he blows up at you through some fault of yours that you should be working harder to correct. If there are people in your life you can talk to about this right now, please tell them what you’ve told me and enlist their support in getting out of this relationship, because things will not get better, and he will not change. Q. My roommate is Peggy Hill: What’s the etiquette for asking to move furniture in a shared living space? My roommate is the sort of person who thinks he is the expert on everything and constantly interrupts and explains things that are not pertinent or things I already know. He has had multiple jobs since we’ve moved in, and he’s always complained about being the most competent person at his workplace. That’s not the problem. Part of sharing a home is putting up with irritating habits. The problem is that he is very possessive of our apartment. He has taken the larger bedroom for himself (my boyfriend and I share a room half the size even though we all pay the same rent), and he purchases large pieces of furniture, rearranges them, and decorates them every few weeks. Recently, several items he has set up and installed have come crashing down. One item was a heavy shelf. When I looked at the wall afterward, I saw that this was because he had used naked wood screws (!) to hold it up. I specifically remember telling him to use anchors when installing in the drywall, but he said he “knew what he was doing.” There are currently five enormously heavy shelves above the guest bed. They are hefty enough to kill a person. My sister is coming to visit soon, and I know that the likelihood of them falling the exact moment she is on the bed is improbable, but it’s stressing me out. I would like to be able to just move the bed to the other side of the room, but since he’s so possessive, he wouldn’t like it if I did it without explanation, but if I explained why, he’d take that personally as well. Should I explain it to him and let him be huffy with me? Should I just psychically will the shelves to stay up while my sister is here? Is there a possible solution I’m overlooking? There are no wrong answers. A: There is definitely one wrong answer, and that’s to let your sister sleep directly under five heavy shelves that, if precedent is any indication, are about to collapse on her head. (It’s part of how we lost Teena Marie!) Say to your roommate, “Since a number of your DIY projects have collapsed, I’m moving the bed to the other side of the room for my sister’s visit.” This is a simple recitation of facts. If your roommate would like to get upset about reality, he is of course free to do so. This may fall outside of the category of “acceptable-yet-irritating roommate behavior.” Living with someone who’s incompetent and defensive when it comes to building furniture (especially heavy furniture that looms over your heads) sounds like a headache you don’t need. Top Comment Should I let my sister sleep under shelves held to the wall with spit and a dream? Good god, no wall anchors! That's what you get for having a man do a lesbian's job. More... Join In Advertisement Q. Traveling blues: For the past 2.5 years I and a few other people have been planning a trip to Ireland. I have been saving diligently, taking on two part-time jobs in addition to my full-time job to afford the trip. From the start I’ve told my boyfriend that I would love for him to come along but that he would have to pay for himself, as there is no way I can afford to pay for us both. For the past two years he has been largely dismissive and showed no interest in coming. Now I’m at the stage of booking flights and hotels and suddenly he really wants to go but can’t afford to and says I should either lend him the money or postpone my trip until he can afford to go. I told him I would send him a postcard from Ireland. Am I being unreasonable? A: Nope. Go to Ireland, have a great time, and send your boyfriend a postcard. Consider sending him nothing at all.

      "text" : "As the media class struggles to understand an election result few foresaw, some have blamed a quirk of modern technology.“The ‘Filter Bubble’ Explains Why Trump Won and You Didn’t See It Coming,” New York magazine announced the day after the election. “Your Filter Bubble Is Destroying Democracy,” Wired declared a week out. One month in, an M.I.T. Media Lab analysis confirmed that Trump supporters “exist in their own information bubble,” as Vice reported — and that journalists didn’t let Trump supporters into their bubbles, either.The filter bubble describes the tendency of social networks like Facebook and Twitter to lock users into personalized feedback loops, each with its own news sources, cultural touchstones and political inclinations. We seem to like these places, and so do social media companies — they keep us clicking from one self-affirmation to another. But now our bubbles are being blamed for leading us toward the most divisive presidency in recent memory, and suddenly, the bubble doesn’t feel so inviting anymore. So media and tech companies are pivoting, selling us a whole suite of offerings aimed at bursting the bubbles they helped to create.Few people get a kick out of acknowledging their own biases, so new digital features are easing the way with candy-colored visuals and interactive quizzes. Download the Chrome extension PolitEcho and watch as it crawls through your Facebook network and visualizes its political bias based on how many of your friends “like” pages dedicated to Breitbart, Marco Rubio, Bernie Sanders or NPR. Then hop over to the PBS website and take a quiz, conceived by the libertarian Charles Murray, that rates your affiliation with “mainstream American culture.” (Rack up real-American points for having evangelical Christian friends, eating at IHOP and watching “Dr. Phil.”)Other tech products invite us to reach out and understand other people without the hassle of actually talking to them. FlipFeed, a Twitter plug-in created by M.I.T. researchers, provides a voyeuristic thrill: Click a button, and your regular Twitter feed is replaced by that of a random, anonymous user of a different political persuasion. (It’s perfect for seeing how the other half live-tweets a Trump news conference.) And the iPhone app Read Across the Aisle gamifies political outreach — as you read articles from The Huffington Post or The Federalist through the app, you’ll see a meter turn red or blue based on the particular site’s ideological bent.The real ingenuity of these solutions lies in stripping opposing ideas of their negative emotional impact. It’s not too hard to find people who disagree with you online — just create a Twitter account, state an opinion and watch the haters roll up — but the heated social media climate provides a tense, abstracted version of human connection that often leaves both sides more polarized. To alleviate the tension, BuzzFeed is testing a new feature, “Outside Your Bubble,” which pulls in opinions from across the web and gives them a neutral platform. A curator takes the often-emotional comments, removes them from their combative context and rephrases them as cogent, dispassionate bullet points.Escape Your Bubble, a plug-in that seeds your Facebook feed with opposing political views, goes a step further, repackaging partisan content with an aggressively positive affect. Each story appears with a pink heart icon and a banner that says: “Happily inserted by your EscapeYourBubble Chrome Extension :)”Meanwhile, a new crop of online media offerings comes equipped with like-minded guides who travel to the other side and present their findings. Every week, the Washington journalist Will Sommer publishes a kicky newsletter digest, “Right Richter,” which aggregates right-wing perspectives for left-leaning audiences. Slate’s “Today in Conservative Media” feature provides a similar service. And Crooked Media, a political podcast network created by former Obama staffers, just debuted a new show, “With Friends Like These,” in which the liberal journalist Ana Marie Cox shepherds listeners through conversations with conservative guests.A cynical impulse lies behind many of these kumbaya vibes. The same social media networks that helped build the bubbles are now being framed as the solution, with just a few surface tweaks. On the internet, the “echo chambers” of old media — the ’90s buzzword for partisan talk radio shows and political paperbacks — have been amplified and automated. We no longer need to channel-surf to Fox News or MSNBC; unseen algorithms on Facebook learn to satisfy our existing preferences, so it doesn’t feel like we’re choosing an ideological filter at all.But now, no entity is playing the filter bubble crisis more than Facebook itself. The company’s leader, Mark Zuckerberg, has published a manifesto of sorts, “Building Global Community,” which jockeys for Facebook to seize a central role in opening our minds by exposing us to new ideas.Just last summer, the company was whistling a different tune. In a blog post called “Building a Better News Feed for You,” Facebook declared that the information it serves up is “subjective, personal, and unique — and defines the spirit of what we hope to achieve.” That all seemed harmless when the network was a site for reconnecting with old high school friends, but now Facebook is a major driver of news. (A Pew study from last year found that 62 percent of Americans get news on social media.) And as Mr. Trump rose, Facebook found itself assailed by critics blaming it for eroding the social fabric and contributing to the downfall of democracy. Facebook gave people what they wanted, they said, but not what they needed. So now it talks of building the “social infrastructure” for a “civically-engaged community.” Mr. Zuckerberg quoted Abraham Lincoln as inspiration for Facebook’s next phase.The agitators and audiences for these new fixes have an ulterior motive for expanding their horizons, too. Recent calls to burst the filter bubble have come largely from liberals and #NeverTrump conservatives alarmed by their election losses. Their bipartisan spirit has partisan roots. President Trump’s critics feel the practical need to break down these ideological cocoons, so they can win next time. Charlie Sykes, a former conservative radio talk show host who was blindsided by Mr. Trump’s win, now writes of the need to dismantle the “tribal bubble” of modern American politics, where citizens are informed through partisan media and bullied into submission by Twitter mobs. And Sam Altman, the president of the start-up incubator Y Combinator, recently set out from the liberal Silicon Valley and traveled across America to better understand the perspectives of Trump voters. His final question to them: “What would convince you not to vote for him again?”It will be more difficult to entice Trump supporters to consider alternative perspectives, and not just because the president himself has declared the mainstream media the “opposition party.” As members of the winning team, Trump supporters have no urgent need to understand the other side. Besides, it’s not too hard to find left-of-center perspectives in the news media. Typical members of the mainstream media are, if not expressly ideological liberal, then at least poorly positioned to pass Charles Murray’s “mainstream American culture” quiz.In his manifesto, Mr. Zuckerberg spoke of the need to grow local news outlets (which have seen their prospects plummet even further as Facebook tightens its grip as a leading source of news) and present people with a range of perspectives. Whether those sentiments make their way into every feed remains to be seen — after all, Facebook became an internet superpower by serving up easy, compulsively clickable content. Some Americans are interested in peeking outside their filter bubbles right now, which gives tech companies an incentive to cater to their desires. Will they feel the same way when they’re winning again?",

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/three-hard-lessons-the-internet-is-teaching-traditional-stores-1492945203With brick and mortar stores shuttering at a record pace, retail in the U.S. feels like it’s at a tipping point. Many of the stores that once filled the malls of America have become “zombies,” while online retailers capture ever more of the most valuable consumers—the young and affluent.Legacy retailers are trying to play catch-up, but they’re saddled by huge fixed costs, investors who prefer dividends to innovations, and CEOs incentivized to focus on the next quarter, not the next decade. It’s only a matter of time before Amazon.com ’s AMZN -0.39% army of physical retail formats turn into an existential threat to everyone from Mom and Pop to Kroger and Wal-Mart . WMT 0.19% That doesn’t mean retailers are taking this lying down. As online brands begin to build physical shops, the old guard is taking notes—and in many cases, writing checks. Wal-Mart, for example, has been on an acquisition binge of late. It’s now in talks to buy men’s clothier Bonobos for $300 million.After surveying analysts and CEOs, I learned the three biggest lessons physical retailers are grappling with as they face this rocky transition.

Why so cagey? Perhaps because of the uproar that occurred when Target sent coupons for baby clothes and cribs to the home of a teenage girl, alerting her family she was pregnant, says Michelle Evans, an analyst at consumer research firm Euromonitor.Data has been a vital part of Amazon’s retail revolution, just as it was with Netflix ’s media revolution and Google and Facebook ’s advertising revolution. For brick-and-mortar retailers, purchasing data doesn’t just help them compete with online adversaries; it has also become an alternate revenue source when profit margins are razor thin. For example, Unilever might buy store sales data to figure out which products are in high demand and when people buy them. (Ms. Evans says that when retailers sell data, it’s anonymized and not linked to individual consumers.)Physical retailers must catch up to online retailers in collecting rich data without making it feel so intrusive. Why, exactly, does my grocery store need my phone number?There’s a debate in the auto industry: Can Tesla get good at making cars faster than Ford, General Motors and Toyota can get good at making self-driving electric vehicles? The same applies to retail: Can physical retailers build intimate digital relationships with their customers—and use that data to update their stores—faster than online-first retailers can learn how to lease property, handle inventory and manage retail workers?Online retailers know what’s popular, and how customers who like one item tend to like certain others. So Amazon’s physical bookstores can put out fewer books with more prominently displayed covers. Bonobos doesn’t even sell clothes in its stores, which it calls ”guideshops.” Instead, customers go there to try clothes on, and their selections are delivered through the company’s existing e-commerce system.Amazon’s upcoming Go convenience stores, selling groceries and meal kits, don’t even require cashiers. That’s the sort of automation that could position Amazon to reap margins—or slash prices—to a degree unprecedented for retailers in traditionally low-margin categories like food and packaged goods.While online retailers are accustomed to updating inventory and prices by the hour, physical retailers simply don’t have the data or the systems to keep up, and tend to buy and stock on cycles as long as a year, says George Faigen, a retail consultant at Oliver Wyman. Some legacy retailers are getting around this by teaming up with online players.Target stocks men’s shaving supplies from not one but two online upstarts, Harry’s and Bevel. Target has said that, as a result, more customers are coming in to buy razors, increasing the sales of every brand on that aisle—even good old Gillette. Retailers have long relied on manufacturers to drive customers to stores by marketing their goods and even managing in-store displays. The difference is this: In the past, new brands had to persuade store buyers to dole out precious shelf space; now the brands can prove themselves online first.Perhaps the biggest challenge for existing retailers, says Euromonitor’s Ms. Evans, is finding the money to transition to this hybrid online-offline model. While Target has announced it will spend $7 billion over the next three years to revamp its stores, investors fled the stock in February after Target reported 2017 profits might be 25% less than expected.When Warby Parker, the online eyeglasses retailer, set out to launch stores across the U.S., the company looked for in-store sales software that could integrate with its existing e-commerce systems. It couldn’t find a system up to the task, so it built one from scratch.These kinds of systems allow salespeople to know what customers have bought both online and off, and what they might be nudged toward on that day. “We call it the ‘point of everything’ system,” says David Gilboa, co-founder and co-chief executive.Having this much customer knowledge available instantly is critical, but it’s precisely what existing retailers struggle with, Mr. Faigen says.Even Amazon is experiencing brick-and-mortar difficulties. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Go stores would be delayed because of kinks in the point-of-sale software system.Andy Katz-Mayfield, co-founder and co-chief executive of Harry’s, is skeptical that traditional retailers like Wal-Mart can make the leap, even if they invest heavily in technology.The problem, he says, is that selling online isn’t just about taking orders through a website. Companies that succeed are good at selling direct to consumers—building technology from the ground up, integrating teams skilled at navigating online marketing’s ever-shifting terrain and managing the experience through fulfillment and delivery, Mr. Katz-Mayfield says.That e-commerce startups are so confident about their own future doesn’t mean they are right about the fate of traditional retailers, however. A report from Merrill Lynch argues Wal-Mart is embarking on a period of 20% to 30% growth for its e-commerce business. A spokesman for the company said that in addition to acquisitions, the company is focused on growing its e-commerce business organically.It isn’t hard to picture today’s e-commerce companies becoming brick-and-mortar retailers. It’s harder to bet on traditional retailers becoming as tech savvy as their e-competition. Appeared in the Apr. 24, 2017, print edition as 'Three Difficult Lessons For Traditional Retailers.'

Help is not needed: I recently tried to assist a disabled person getting out of an SUV onto a wheelchair. At the time, it seemed like she had trouble controlling the chair, and I rushed to help. She was brought to tears as she tried to get me to move away. But then she seemed like she was about to fall again while trying to sit in the chair. In retrospect, I think I might have overreacted. But, again, she insisted that I did not help her. I see that person more or less every day, and I am uncomfortable about the right thing. I don’t know if apologizing will make things worse. Is there anything to do to make this right or less awkward? Subscribe to Prudie! A: You say the woman in question seemed “about to fall again” but not that she ever actually fell, a detail I believe you would have included had it actually happened. Ask yourself why you did not back off the first time this woman asked you to leave her alone. Did you assume that, because she’s in a wheelchair, she doesn’t know her own limits and when she does or doesn’t need assistance? There’s nothing wrong about wanting to help someone, but there is something wrong with repeatedly ignoring someone who’s saying “No, please stop” until you’ve pushed them to the point of tears. What you did was neither helpful nor kind, regardless of what your intentions were, and you do owe her an apology. Apologize for assuming that she didn’t know what she was talking about when she said she could get out of her own car without assistance, for continuing to foist yourself on her after repeated requests to stop, and for making her cry. Make it clear that you’ll never touch her or her chair without her express permission again and that you’re making a concerted effort to change your behavior in the future. In the future, if you see someone who may possibly need help with something, you don’t have to squash the impulse entirely; just ask, “Can I help you?” and let yourself be guided by their answer. If someone says, “No thanks, I’ve got it,” take them at their word and back off. Advertisement Q. Shrunken ethics: I started seeing a shrink a few years ago for general life stuff. I’ve gone from seeing her every week to once a month, and in general life has been getting better. As I was leaving the office today she said seemingly in passing, “You know, it’s too bad it’s unethical for me to introduce you to my daughter, I think she’d like you and you’d like her.” My take on the situation is that she wouldn’t have said anything unless she was looking for permission from me to do so. I’m interested in the possibility, in part because dating in South Florida is lackluster, in part because what she’s mentioned about her daughter in the past has intrigued me. Is it really unethical for her to do that? Is my read on the situation correct? Is there a way to parlay the “offhanded comment” into an actual meeting? A: It’s a testament to how highly your therapist thinks of you that she considers you a viable romantic possibility for her daughter. Or it is a testament to your therapist’s iffy judgment. (How much is she talking about her daughter in your therapy sessions?) Assuming your therapist is not also a psychologist bound by APA guidelines, this is tricky but subjective territory rather than an out-and-out violation of professional ethics. You can certainly revisit the issue with your therapist if you like (“You mentioned last week that you’d like me to meet your daughter, but felt like it might be unethical. If you’re concerned about issues of consent, you should know that I’d be interested”), although you should be prepared to hear no for an answer. If she does want to introduce you to her daughter, and you two do hit it off, you should end your professional relationship with the mother regardless of whether you find another therapist elsewhere or decide discontinue therapy for the time being. Before you say anything, however, bear in mind that there is pretty much only one way this can go well, and any number of ways this can go wrong. In general, I think we would all be better off for not dating our therapists’ children. Very few people on their deathbeds croak out in tones of deep regret, “If only I had dated my therapist’s daughter.” That’s not to say no one can ever date their therapist’s daughter, merely that discretion in this case is probably the better part of valor. Imagine yourself trying to avoid both an ex-therapist and an ex-girlfriend at your local drugstore at the same time six months from now. If that mental image makes the South Floridian dating scene seem a little more appealing, head for greener pastures. Q. Dog not on bed: I love my boyfriend and I love dogs, but not on my bed. He has two huge dogs that he sleeps with, and if I stay over I always end up getting crowded out to the couch or accidentally pushing a dog off the bed. And I have to remind him to put them out of the room when we have sex. He doesn’t care. He usually spends the night at my house, but we are talking about him moving in as his rent is going up. I have a nice home with nice furniture: My dog is trained not to get up on them. My boyfriend gets upset when I tell him we need to train his dogs. We argue about it because I want to do it now before he moves in, and he says he doesn’t have time right now and we can do it later. His lease ends in two months. What should I do? It feels like a stupid point to pause our relationship over but it bugs me that he wouldn’t do this small act for me. Advertisement A: “We can do it later” means, in this case, “we will never do it, and when I move in with you I will continue to let the dogs push you out of bed, and ‘forget’ to move them when we have sex.” There’s nothing “stupid” about not wanting to get pushed off your own bed and onto the couch every night in your own home or for not wanting to accidentally kick a dog out of bed in your sleep. Make it a precondition of living together that the dogs are trained to sleep in their own beds. If your boyfriend can’t or won’t do that, don’t move in with him. Q. Family money: I’m a trans woman. My mom freaked out when I tried to express how I felt as a kid and always forced me to wear typical boy’s clothes and play with appropriately masculine toys. My Aunt D (her sister) was the complete opposite. Growing up, I spent at least one weekend a month at her house while Mom partied. She let me wear dresses and play with dolls and makeup. I had my own closet and toy box at her house filled with my “real” clothes and toys—things that would have been thrown away if they appeared at my mom’s house. She was incredibly supportive and, truthfully, was more mother to me than my actual mother. Sadly, Aunt D passed away a few months ago after a brutal, but thankfully brief, battle with cancer. I was and still am heartbroken. Thankfully I have a loving partner and wonderful friends to help me through the grief. My family has been less supportive. Except for a few thousand dollars put into a trust for my half-sister, Aunt D left everything to me. She was a very hard worker and good with money, though I was still shocked by the amount. My mother and sister were livid when they found out, feeling that Aunt D should have provided more for my sister, and are now demanding that I split my inheritance with her. The thing is, my aunt tried very hard to develop a close loving relationship with my sister as she did with me, but my sister just didn’t care. She’s a lot like my mother—very narcissistic and only interested in people who can do things for her. She once claimed that spending too much time with Aunt D would turn her into a “freak like me.” I’m tired of being hounded by her and my mother, but I also feel like she shouldn’t profit from my aunt’s death when she was so dismissive of her while she was alive. What should I do? A: Stop taking their calls and emails and texts. If all your mother and sister have ever done for you is mock your identity and demand money from you, you should feel free to ignore their future requests with a clear conscience. If they’re not able to take “No” for an answer, then you should feel free to ignore them entirely. Advertisement Q. Boyfriend wants to do everything together: I’ve been with my boyfriend for nine months and while he’s great for the most part, he wants me to pursue his hobbies X and Y with him even though I’m not interested (after trying them out a few times, of course). I’ve always believed in maintaining separate interests outside a relationship while also having shared common interests, but it’s gotten to the point where he accuses of me not being open-minded when I decline his request to do X and Y. I don’t want to break up with him over this, but it’s gotten to the point where it’s stressing me out every single time I say no even though I’ve already explained I’m not interested already! How can I remedy this situation? A: “I’m glad you want us to spend time together, and I’m glad that mountain juicing/Paleo Sudoku/reverse cosplay brings you so much joy, but I’m not interested in merging hobbies, and I actually enjoy maintaining separate interests in a relationship. I’m getting the impression you don’t feel the same way. In an ideal version of our relationship, how often do you see me accompanying you on these outings?” You may not want to break up over this, and I don’t think you should reach for the breakup as your first option right away, but this is an opportunity to determine whether you two have compatible ideas of what a relationship looks like. If he wants a girlfriend who’s willing to participate in his hobbies as much as he does, and you don’t, then a breakup is not only inevitable but desirable so you two don’t drive one another wild with frustration and opposing expectations. Q. Is it cold feet?: I’m engaged to be married. My fiancé and I have been together for five years, and we’ve been planning our wedding now for six months—it’ll be in June so we have a couple of months to go. In the past few weeks I’ve been starting to feel really nervous about the whole thing. Last night, I was making wedding centerpieces with a friend of mine and I confessed that I wasn’t sure I wanted to get married. My friend said it was cold feet and that everybody feels that way. I’m not sure. It isn’t that I don’t love my fiancé. I just don’t know if I want to get married to him, or to anyone for that matter. My parents and his are both divorced. (His father has been married/divorced five times!) Most of my friends are either divorced or having trouble. I just don’t know if spending all this money on a wedding is worth it, if it is only going to end in a few years anyway. How can you tell if feeling the jitters before a wedding is cold feet, or something else? A: I do not have a rock-solid rubric for distinguishing between garden-variety cold feet and Serious Doubts, but I do believe that an excellent treatment for commitment-related anxieties is to share them. Even if “everybody feels that way,” that’s no reason to keep your fears to yourself. You don’t have to burst into your fiancé’s room shouting “I’M NOT SURE ABOUT YOU, GUY,” but you can—and should!—say that you’re feeling nervous and anxious at the prospect of getting married, and that you wanted to share that with him not as preparation for running out on him, but so he can know what’s going on with you, both good and bad. You might also consider premarital counseling, which is a great investment, even if the wedding is only a few months away. Whether these jitters are cold feet or something else, they’re worth addressing now, not sweeping under the rug. Advertisement Q. The sanctity of sleep: Mallory, you’ve talked a lot lately about the moral decrepitude of those who interrupt the sleep of others—those who allow their alarms to run for hours, those who awaken sleeping spouses (no arguments here, those people are awful). But you’ve also decried the snooze button and those who need multiple alarms. But what else is a heavy sleeper to do? I have always needed very loud, very insistent alarms to wake me. My high school alarm clock woke the whole house, but it was the only way for me to get out of bed in time short of being shaken awake manually by another person. I quickly learn to snooze any alarm in my sleep, and it’s not a choice I’m really making when I’m half-asleep. Vibrating smartwatch alarms are easily slept through or snoozed. I don’t have a sleep disorder, I’m just a very heavy sleeper and not a morning person. What should we be doing? What is your solution for the other end of the snooze stick? A: There is an important caveat to the No Snooze Buttons rule: If your sleep partner doesn’t mind, or if you sleep alone, you can hit snooze as often as you like. You don’t say that you have a partner or roommate who’s irritated by your repeat alarms, and there’s nothing wrong with the snooze button as long as it’s not disturbing someone else who’s trying to sleep. I’m not anti–snooze button qua snooze button nor against heavy sleepers as a class of people. Being difficult to wake up is not a sign of moral turpitude; it’s just how your brain works. The problem begins only when this behavior negatively affects other people and the heavy sleeper in question does nothing to change their morning routine. That said, if you’re looking for ways to keep yourself from half-consciously hitting snooze without realizing it, put your phone on the other side of the room so you have to get up to turn it off in the morning. Q. Re: Shrunken ethics: I have worked in the mental health field for 25 years as a support staff to therapists (master’s-level clinical social workers). My understanding has been that they avoid speaking about their personal lives and family members as much as possible. My understanding has been that it is considered a major distraction to the patient’s care and creates undesirable boundary issues. One of my supervisors (a master’s-level therapist) carefully explained once that she and her family have a routine in case she bumps into a client in public. It involved the family member discreetly leaving the area to avoid any interaction with or meeting their relative’s client. I am surprised by your response as I had never heard that there are different ethics for psychologists vs. psychotherapists. Advertisement A: Bearing in mind that I am neither a psychologist nor a therapist, and may very well be wrong, I was merely referring to the formal code of ethics that psychologists must abide by. It certainly seems like the therapist in question has done something unusual, but it sounds (to this layperson at least) like more of a boundary crossing rather than a boundary violation—potentially hazardous, and something most therapists would avoid, but not necessarily a violation of ethics. If there are any therapists out there who want to offer their professional opinions of this person’s behavior, please chime in!

Rude or kind?: Two days ago, I was in a local coffee shop eating a bagel that had cream cheese on it. As I was finishing and reading my book, a man approached me from the other side of the room with two napkins motioning very largely for me to wipe my mouth, which had a tad of cream cheese on it. To me, this comes across as rude because I already had a napkin visibly handy—and in a crowded shop, seemed unnecessary and embarrassing to point out. My family thinks this wasn’t in the slightest rude but helpful. What do you think? A: It was kind of rude. It’s not rude enough to find him and tell him off, so there’s not really anything you can do about it, but if it helps you to think, “That guy was trying to be helpful but came across as a little presumptuous and rude,” then you have my express permission. It is also fine to forget about it! Let the moment, like the cream cheese, pass out of your life. Discuss this column with Dear Prudence on her Facebook page!

      "text" : "As the D.C. budget grows more flush and housing prices continue to soar, concentrated poverty among households with children persists in some areas, according to a report released Tuesday. The report by a local advocacy agency found that the overall median income of D.C. families has climbed since 2010. But families living in Wards 7 and 8, the only wards east of the Anacostia River, have experienced sharp declines. D.C. Action for Children’s annual “Ward Snapshots” report breaks down child poverty rates and family economics by ward, saying that as the city fills its coffers, it needs to ensure that families across the city benefit from it. “As the District gets more wealthy, how is it affecting all kids?” Shana Bartley, the group’s acting executive director, said of the report. “Ward Snapshots” culled data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the D.C. Department of Health, the D.C. Office of the State Superintendent of Education and more. [DC. has a problem that it never expected: Too much money] Since 2010, the number of young children living in the city has increased by 23 percent, and children younger than 5 account for nearly 40 percent of the child population. But the wards with the highest share of these young children — Wards 5, 7 and 8 — have the lowest median family incomes. In Ward 8, for example, the median family income dropped nearly 17 percent between ­2006-2010 and 2010-2015, from $28,979 to $24,096. Likewise, in Ward 7, the median family income during those years went from $34,562 to $31,273, a nearly 10 percent drop. By comparison, the median family income in Ward 2 jumped nearly 65 percent, from $114,752 to $189,324. Bartley said that one factor driving these disparate incomes is that as families are priced out of neighborhoods in Wards 1 and 2, for example, they are moving to Ward 8, the city’s poorest ward. While the overall child poverty rate has declined to 26.7 percent — a drop of three percentage points since 2010 — there has been a slight uptick in Wards 3, 4 and 8. Ward 3 had a child poverty rate of 2.9 percent in 2015, compared with Ward 8’s 49 percent. Some of the increases could be attributed to rising housing costs. Ward 3’s rate was previously 2.4 percent; Ward 8’s was 48.3 percent. The report found that more than 40 percent of D.C. residents spend more than a third of their monthly income on rent and related costs. The number of children enrolled in Medicaid increased by 21 percent, with the largest jumps in Wards 3, 4 and 8. local Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

See all newsletters Some positive trends also emerged: In Wards 7 and 8, teen pregnancy rates steadily declined between 2010 and 2015, and students’ standardized test scores there saw slight increases between 2015 and 2016. The report does not create a new narrative in the nation’s capital: The city has long been divided by race and socioeconomics. The report suggests that the wave of wealth the city has seen in recent years — the D.C. budget has reserves totaling $2.4 billion — has not trickled to all residents equitably. “The biggest thing for the District to be is forward thinking,” Bartley said. “We’re continuing to see a baby boom, we are seeing families laying down roots in the city, public school enrollment is increasing, but we have to make sure that there’s infrastructure in the city to support healthy growth for all families and kids in the District.” D.C. Action for Children recommends that the city boost access to quality early-childhood care and education, use census and local demographic data to determine how to allocate the city’s budget, and put more resources toward home-visiting programs that would support maternal and child health. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser released her 2018 $13.8 billion budget earlier this month that proposes modest spending increases for affordable housing, homeless services and education.",

      "text" : "TOKYO — North Korea put on a huge military spectacle Saturday to celebrate its founder’s birthday, parading its series of new and technologically advanced missiles in front of Kim Jong Un, and in a defiant show of force in front of the world. North Korea did not, however, carry out another nuclear test or ballistic missile launch, against widespread speculation that it would seek to celebrate Kim Il Sung’s 105th birthday with a bang. April 15 is the most important day in the North Korean calendar, and Kim Jong Un has celebrated his grandfather’s birthday with great fanfare as a way to boost his own legitimacy as the successor to the communist dynasty. North Korea presented two of its newest missiles at the parade in Kim Il Sung Square on Saturday, including the submarine-launched ballistic missile it successfully fired last year and the land-based version it launched last month. “And there were a lot of them,” said Melissa Hanham, an expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California. Trump says good trade with China hinges on help with North Korea Embed Copy Share Play Video1:32 (White House) President Trump spoke highly of Chinese President Xi during a press conference at the White House on April 12, but avoided commenting directly on the decision not to label China a currency manipulator. \"We're going to see,\" he said when asked if a deal was struck. Trump spoke highly of China's president on April 12, but avoided commenting directly on his decision not to label China a currency manipulator. (White House) “The signal that they’re trying to send is that they are moving ahead with solid-fuel missiles,” she said. North Korea has been working on solid fuel, which means missiles are ready to fire and don’t need loading with propellant like its previous liquid-fuel missiles, as a way to fire missiles quickly and without detection by satellites. It did not show off the KN-08 and KN-11 intercontinental ballistic missiles it had included in previous parades, the long-range rockets with the technical ability to reach the mainland United States that it is developing. But it instead put fuel canisters on the trucks that had carried the ICBMs previously, suggesting Pyongyang wanted to reinforce the message that it can now fuel these longer-range missiles. The parade took place amid stern warnings from the outside world, and mounting fears about some kind of military action in the region. The United States has sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the Korean Peninsula region, and President Trump has repeatedly tweeted that if China will not use its leverage to rein in North Korea, the United States will act. Vice President Pence arrives in Seoul on Sunday on the first leg of an Asia tour, and he will doubtless underscore Washington’s strong alliances with South Korea and Japan and their determination to stop North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. China on Friday urged the United States and North Korea not to push their recriminations to a point of no return and allow war to break out on the peninsula. North Korea holds massive military parade as tensions rise in region Embed Copy Share Play Video0:57 (Reuters) North Korea held a military parade April 15 to mark the 105th birthday of its founder Kim Il Sung. The event comes as tensions are rising in the region. The U.S. has been conducting large-scale military exercises with South Korean forces, drills that North Korea considers provocative. North Korea held a military parade April 15 to mark the 105th birthday of its founder Kim Il Sung. The event comes as tensions are rising in the region. (Reuters) Foreign Minister Wang Yi said “storm clouds” were gathering, an apparent reference to North Korean preparations to conduct a new nuclear test and the United States’ deployment of a naval strike force to the waters off the peninsula. In addition, the U.S. military has been conducting large-scale exercises with South Korean forces, drills that the North considers provocative. [Why is April 15 such a big deal in North Korea?] “The United States and South Korea and North Korea are engaging in tit for tat, with swords drawn and bows bent,” Wang said at a news conference after meeting with visiting French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, ­Xinhua reported. “We urge all parties to refrain from inflammatory or threatening statements or deeds to prevent irreversible damage to the situation on the Korean Peninsula.” Later Friday, Wang called his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and said it was in both countries’ interests to prevent an outbreak of war. “China welcomes close collaboration with Russia to cool down the Korean Peninsula situation as quickly as possible and encourage the involved parties to resume dialogue,” he said, according to China’s Foreign Ministry. Separately, China’s Global Times newspaper said the U.S. decision to drop “the mother of all bombs” in Afghanistan this week would have sent a “shock wave” all the way to North Korea but might send the wrong signal to Kim Jong Un — that without nuclear weapons he would suffer the same fate as Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Moammar Gaddafi. “It would be nice if the bomb could frighten Pyongyang but its actual impact may just be the opposite,” the paper said. Trump administration officials describe the situation as more dangerous than in the past, because of the progress North Korea has made in its nuclear and missile programs and because of the hostility on both sides. But U.S. officials said no decision has been made about how to respond to any new test — nuclear or ballistic — by North Korea. While officials do not rule out other actions, they also stress their desire to ensure that the situation does not escalate out of control. Pentagon officials denied recent media reports that the Trump administration is ready to launch a preemptive strike if North Korea appears to be about to conduct a nuclear test. North Korea Friday accused President Trump of “making trouble” with his “aggressive” tweets, amid concerns that tensions between the two countries could escalate into military action. [ As North Korea celebrates anniversary, its neighbors are united by jitters ] North Korea’s vice foreign minister said that Trump was “becoming more vicious and more aggressive” than previous presidents and that this was only making matters worse. “Trump is always making provocations with his aggressive words,” Han Song Ryol told the Associated Press in an interview in Pyongyang. “So that’s why. It’s not the DPRK but the U.S. and Trump that makes trouble,” he said, using the abbreviation for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as North Korea is officially known. Han also repeated the regime’s common refrain that North Korea is ready to act to defend itself. “We’ve got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands, and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a U.S. preemptive strike,” Han told the AP. His message chimed with a statement Friday from North Korea’s Institute for Disarmament and Peace that it was the United States pushing the Korean Peninsula, “the world’s biggest hotspot,” to the brink of war by bringing back a naval strike group. “This has created a dangerous situation in which a thermonuclear war may break out any moment on the peninsula and pose a serious threat to the world’s peace and security,” the statement said. North Korea has a habit of fueling tensions to increase the rewards it might extract from the outside world if it desists. Previously, the North has agreed to return to denuclearization talks in return for aid or the easing of sanctions. The North Korean army meanwhile threatened to annihilate U.S. military bases in South Korea and the presidential palace in Seoul in response to what it called Trump’s “maniacal military provocations.” [ Kim Jong Un’s rockets are getting an important boost — from China ] With his approach, Trump is tearing up the old playbook of how to deal with North Korea, analysts said. “This approach to North Korea is relatively new,” said James Kim of the Asan Institute of Policy Studies in Seoul. “The approach in the past has been very calculated.” That has gone out the window with talk about military options, he said. “We always knew all these options were there, but no one was bold enough to go down that path. It’s a new approach.” Some in Beijing are noticing the shift, too. “It should be noted that there is a personality difference between Trump and Obama,” the Global Times newspaper wrote Friday. The paper does not speak for the Chinese government on policy but often reflects a strain of thinking within the Communist Party. “Trump is also willing to show he is different. Bombing Syria helps him to show that,” it continued, while noting that he was far from “revolutionary” because he dispatched only missiles, not troops. But North Korea could prove different if it ignores Trump’s warning and conducts another nuclear test, the paper said. “Trump just took the office; if he loses to Pyongyang, he would feel like he had lost some prestige.” Right now, Trump has some cards to play, said Kim of the Asan Institute. “He might say: ‘If you want one less battleship in the region, what are you going to give me?’ ” he said — a reversal of the usual situation, in which North Korea asks what it can get from its adversaries in return for changing its behavior. [ Will North Korea fire a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland? Probably. ] Trump’s tweets and his conversations with Chinese President Xi Jinping seem designed to push Beijing to crack down on North Korea, and there have been some indications that China is getting tougher on its errant neighbor. China suspended coal imports from North Korea in mid-February — potentially cutting off an economic lifeline — and Chinese customs data released Thursday showed a 52 percent drop in imports in the first three months of this year, compared with the same period last year. world asia_pacific Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas true endOfArticle false Today's WorldView What's most important from where the world meets Washington Please provide a valid email address.

      "text" : "For a second consecutive weekend, President Trump remained in Washington — tweeting in the morning, holding meetings at the White House and heading to his Virginia golf club on Sunday — all the time surrounded by aides and patrons yet, increasingly, politically marooned. Weighed down by dismal approval ratings, the president has been unable to wrangle enough allies in Congress to advance his agenda and is searching for outside support to defend him from attacks coming from all sides. Ahead of his 100th day in office later this month, Trump has struggled to build a governing coalition that matches the nontraditional alliance that put him in the Oval Office. And he has turned to making enemies out of former supporters among Republicans in Congress, even as Democrats keep him at arm’s length. “He seems both politically and personally isolated these days,” said David Gergen, a former adviser to Democratic and Republican presidents dating back to Richard Nixon. “He’s flailing because he doesn’t know where to find his natural allies.” The result has been a presidency lacking in significant victories, beset by major stumbles — including the downfall of the Republicans’ health-care bill and his travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries — and that is increasingly the target of litigation as a result of executive actions, especially related to the environment. There are more potential roadblocks ahead. Already, congressional Republicans have balked at his proposed budget, and the White House’s insistence on increased spending for the military and wall along the U.S.-Mexico border could imperil a spending bill needed to keep the government running past the end of April. No easy resolution has appeared, and despite loose talk from White House aides and staff-level conversations this week, little has been done to court Democratic support for his priorities. And most Democrats remain wary of Trump’s hard-line policies and incendiary persona. “Part of it is self-imposed,” former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said of Trump’s challenges and political drift, adding that many key players often find it difficult to build a bond with 70-year-old executive. “People know him, they see him at meetings, but it’s been hard for people in Congress and around it to get to know him in a way that’s helpful for Trump.” The White House last week resorted to threats against Democrats and members of its own party in an effort to push members to the negotiating table on repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with the American Health Care Act, a Republican alternative championed by Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) but beleaguered by opposition from conservative groups. But weeks of early, politically damaging battles over controversial policies and an ongoing probe into his campaign’s ties to Russian interference in the election have left Trump with the lowest approval rating of any president since Harry Truman. Most of the right wing Republican House members in the Freedom Caucus, now in the president’s crosshairs, outperformed him in the past election, giving them little incentive to cooperate. “That’s what happens when you have an unpopular president … popularity scares people,” said Ari Fleischer a former adviser to President George W. Bush. “Lack of popularity emboldens them.” The unrest extends to personnel and the Trump political operation. Last week, Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh left the White House to help prop up an outside group, which aims to provide air cover for the president in the legislative battles ahead after a health-care effort that left him exposed to criticism from the left and the right. In the West Wing, frustration abounds. For a president fixated on winning, people close to him say he is anxious to find out what went wrong with his team’s health-care push and get to a deal on that issue or another front such as taxes or infrastructure as fast as possible. Christopher Ruddy, the Newsmax Media chief executive and a friend of Trump’s, said the lesson learned within the White House is to be more careful moving forward when it comes to trusting Congress and the leadership’s whip counts. “The White House did the right thing. Ryan carried the luggage here. He delivered it and it was damaged goods,” Ruddy said of the health legislation. “They wanted to work with Congress, they accepted the congressional plan and it blew up on them. Now they realize they can’t do that in the future.” Although the White House has not settled on a clear path forward, a partial strategy has taken shape on social media: going after the ideological purists who blocked Trump on health care. After dealing initially dealing with the House Freedom Caucus with a carrot, Trump has settled on a stick, promising to “fight” Freedom Caucus members along with Democrats in 2018. Among them: Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a Trump supporter who defended him during one of the darkest periods of his campaign, when lewd “Access Hollywood” video emerged of Trump discussing grabbing women. Trump courted Meadows in meetings and calls, and now White House aides say he feels scorned by Meadows and fellow Freedom Caucus members — and keeps close watch of their television appearances and how they talk about him. But some conservative leaders say the tensions between Trump and the Freedom Caucus could be fleeting because the president may eventually need them to enact legislation in the coming months. “I think there’s a lot of frustration all around town,” said Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action, which backed Freedom Caucus members in opposing the AHCA. “In a couple of weeks people will look back and people will say the coalition in the Republican House and the Senate is a center-right coalition that wants to get big things done.” Trump showed some signs over the weekend of softening his assault on conservatives in Congress. On Sunday morning, he tweeted out a more positive message about unity on health care — “Anybody (especially Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal & Replace of Obamacare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party!” — and later went golfing with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a staunch opponent of the bill who lobbied House conservatives to oppose it. But building support will take more than schmoozing. Needham argued that the White House and congressional leadership asked Republicans to make a politically impossible decision on health care — casting a vote in support of a bill that had a 17 percent public approval rating, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll. That angst remains pervasive with members wondering whether Trump is backing the right kind of bills, the sort of agenda that could lift him and the GOP ahead of the 2018 midterms. Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa), a House Freedom Caucus member, said his office surveyed thousands of constituents about the health-care bill and found the response to be “overwhelmingly against it” — not just among Democrats, but independents and Republicans, too. “I feel pressure, yes, I do: I feel pressure to say no,” he said. “They’re overwhelmingly, resoundingly saying, ‘Thank you for being a no.’ ” As a candidate, Trump leapfrogged over his opponents by running an anti-establishment outsider campaign. He pitched a populist infrastructure bill, tax reform and a border wall — all of which have been held up by a push for a health-care bill more closely associated with long-standing Washington Republican dogma and that critics say fails to address Trump’s promise of making health care less expensive and more widely accessible. Some among Trump’s closest allies are urging him to abandon hard-liners in the Republican conference and strike a deal with Democrats on health care and on other issues. “The president is a dealmaker, and he realizes that 30 members of the House shouldn’t control the process,” Ruddy added. “He is looking for a way to develop a majority that doesn’t include them.” Striking such a deal would likely require even more political acumen than bringing Republicans in line, as it could risk alienating the Republican leadership in Congress and the conservative base. And it would also necessitate that Trump find an ally he can trust on the other side of the aisle. politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Politics newsletter The big stories and commentary shaping the day.

      "text" : "A couple of years ago, it seemed as if everyone I knew was on the verge of divorce.“He’s not the man I married,” one friend told me.“She didn’t change, and I did,” said another.And then there was the no-fault version: “We grew apart.”Emotional and physical abuse are clear-cut grounds for divorce, but they aren’t the most common causes of failing marriages, at least the ones I hear about. What’s the more typical villain? Change.Feeling oppressed by change or lack of change; it’s a tale as old as time. Yet at some point in any long-term relationship, each partner is likely to evolve from the person we fell in love with into someone new — and not always into someone cuter or smarter or more fun. Each goes from rock climber to couch potato, from rebel to middle manager, and from sex crazed to sleep obsessed.Sometimes people feel betrayed by this change. They fell in love with one person, and when that person doesn’t seem familiar anymore, they decide he or she violated the marriage contract. I have begun to wonder if perhaps the problem isn’t change itself but our susceptibility to what has been called the “end of history” illusion.“Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they’re finished,” the Harvard professor Daniel Gilbert said in a 2014 TED talk called “The Psychology of Your Future Self.” He described research that he and his colleagues had done in 2013: Study subjects (ranging from 18 to 68 years old) reported changing much more over a decade than they expected to.In 2015, I published a book about where I grew up, St. Marks Place in the East Village of Manhattan. In doing research, I listened to one person after another claim that the street was a shadow of its former self, that all the good businesses had closed and all the good people had left. This sentiment held true even though people disagreed about which were the good businesses and who were the good people.Nostalgia, which fuels our resentment toward change, is a natural human impulse. And yet being forever content with a spouse, or a street, requires finding ways to be happy with different versions of that person or neighborhood.Because I like to fix broken things quickly and shoddily (my husband, Neal, calls my renovation aesthetic “Little Rascals Clubhouse”), I frequently receive the advice: “Don’t just do something, stand there.”Such underreacting may also be the best stance when confronted by too much or too little change. Whether or not we want people to stay the same, time will bring change in abundance.A year and a half ago, Neal and I bought a place in the country. We hadn’t been in the market for a house, but our city apartment is only 500 square feet, and we kept admiring this lovely blue house we drove by every time we visited my parents. It turned out to be shockingly affordable.So now we own a house. We bought furniture, framed pictures and put up a badminton net. We marveled at the change that had come over us. Who were these backyard-grilling, property-tax-paying, shuttlecock-batting people we had become?When we met in our 20s, Neal wasn’t a man who would delight in lawn care, and I wasn’t a woman who would find such a man appealing. And yet here we were, avidly refilling our bird feeder and remarking on all the cardinals.Neal, who hadn’t hammered a nail in all the years I’d known him, now had opinions on bookshelves and curtains, and loved going to the hardware store. He whistled while he mowed. He was like an alien. But in this new situation, I was an alien, too — one who knew when to plant bulbs and how to use a Crock-Pot, and who, newly armed with CPR and first aid certification, volunteered at a local camp. Our alien selves were remarkably compatible.Several long-married people I know have said this exact line: “I’ve had at least three marriages. They’ve just all been with the same person.” I’d say Neal and I have had at least three marriages: Our partying 20s, child-centric 30s and home-owning 40s.Then there’s my abbreviated first marriage. Nick and I met in college and dated for a few months before dropping out and driving cross-country. Over the next few years, we worked a series of low-wage jobs. On the rare occasions when we discussed our future, he said he wasn’t ready to settle down because one day, he claimed, he would probably need to “sow” his “wild oats” — a saying I found tacky and a concept I found ridiculous.When I told Neal about this years later, he said, “Maybe you found it ridiculous because you’d already done it.”It’s true that from ages 16 to 19 I had a lot of boyfriends. But with Nick, I became happily domestic. We adopted cats. I had changed in such a way that I had no problem being with just one person. I was done changing and thought he should be, too. Certainly, I thought he should not change into a man who sows oats.When we got married at the courthouse so he could get his green card (he was Canadian), I didn’t feel different the next day. We still fell asleep to “Politically Incorrect” with our cats at our feet as we always had.We told anyone who asked that the marriage was no big deal, just a formality so the government wouldn’t break us up. But when pressed, it was hard to say what differentiated us from the truly married beyond the absence of a party.When I grew depressed a few months later, I decided that he and our pseudo-marriage were part of the problem. After three years of feeling like the more committed person, I was done and asked him to move out. When he left, I felt sad but also thrilled by the prospect of dating again. A couple of years later, I met Neal.Recently, I asked Nick if we could talk. We hadn’t spoken in a decade. He lives in London now, so we Skyped. I saw that he looked almost exactly as he had at 22, though he’d grown a long beard. We had a pleasant conversation. Finally, I asked him if he thought our marriage counted.“Yeah,” he said. “I think it counts.”We were married, just not very well. The marriage didn’t mean much to us, and so when things got rough, we broke up. I had been too immature to know what I was getting into. I thought passion was the most important thing. When my romantic feelings left, I followed them out the door. It was just like any breakup, but with extra paperwork.Nick now works at a European arts venue. He’s unmarried. I wouldn’t have predicted his life or his facial hair. I don’t regret our split, but if we had stayed married, I think I would have liked this version of him.My hair is long and blond now. When Neal and I met, it was dyed black and cut to my chin. When I took to bleaching it myself, it was often orange, because I didn’t know what I was doing.Now I weigh about 160 pounds. When I left the hospital after being treated for a burst appendix, I weighed 140. When I was nine months pregnant and starving every second, I weighed 210. I have been everything from size 4 to 14. I have been the life of the party and a drag. I have been broke and loaded, clinically depressed and radiantly happy. Spread out over the years, I’m a harem.How can we accept that when it comes to our bodies (and everything else, for that matter), the only inevitability is change? And what is the key to caring less about change as a marriage evolves — things like how much sex we’re having and whether or not it’s the best sex possible?One day in the country, Neal and I heard a chipmunk in distress. It had gotten inside the house and was hiding under the couch. Every few minutes, the creature let out a high-pitched squeak. I tried to sweep it out the door to safety with a broom, but it kept running back at my feet.“Wow, you’re dumb,” I said to it.“I got this,” Neal said, mysteriously carrying a plastic cereal bowl. “Shoo it out from under there.”I did, and the chipmunk raced through the living room. Neal, like an ancient discus thrower, tossed the bowl in a beautiful arc, landing it perfectly atop the scampering creature. He then slid a piece of cardboard under the bowl and carried the chipmunk out into the bushes, where he set it free.“That was really impressive,” I said.“I know,” he said.To feel awed by a man I thought I knew completely: It’s a shock when that happens after so many years. And a boon. That one fling of a bowl probably bought us another five years of marriage.",

      "text" : "I know it’s Easter. But let’s flash back to the fall.The morning of Nov. 9, the first text I got was from my younger teenage daughter. She was at her dad’s (I am divorced).It read: “Mother dear, although I know you are in legitimate mourning right now, I must ask if there’s any way I can get my computer from you today.”I was stunned. The sang-froid! Rather than hurl herself off a precipice, she wanted to Skype with her boyfriend, David. In Ohio! One of the swing states I’d vowed never to visit again, whose cursed name I would never again utter. (Pennsylvania. Michigan. Wisconsin — even thou, gentle Wisconsin?)True, my girls had never fully grasped how our female lives would have been completely transformed by what I and so many others had anticipated would be a historic she-lection. I had thrillingly pitched flying to Washington for Hillary Clinton’s inauguration. We would wear pantsuits in many colors and boogie down to Pharrell Williams’s “Happy” with other joyous flash-mob dancers.My girls were puzzled. They felt they already saw women in power (Oprah! Ellen!). Their new CoverGirl was a boy. Suzy, 14, couldn’t remember ever not having a black president. Sixteen-year-old Maddy’s gay friends actually favored Bernie Sanders. (Grr! At one point, I hated to see my own first name on a page because it looked too much like “Sanders.” “Move aside old man!” I’d hiss at the cars whizzing by on the freeway with their cheery blue “Bernie” bumper stickers.)“I can’t go on being this upset!” I told my friend Amy, a therapist who had also confessed to a crippling postelection gloom. “The Facebook alerts alone! I think I have to turn them off.”“That’s what they said in Germany,” Amy murmured, ominously.“What did they say?”“‘I’m too upset! I’m getting off Facebook!’’”“They didn’t have Facebook in Germany.”She shook her head. “That’s what they said.”“‘That’s what they said in Germany’ is what they said in Germany?”So my licensed-therapist friend was beyond therapy, and I was a mom who couldn’t think of a reason to live. For solace, I could — possibly — turn to my tribe, the Democrats. During the campaign, I had volunteered and made phone calls. But instead of H.R.C.-ers wittily sharing chardonnay, canapés and hip Colbert skits about Melania’s plagiarization, these were grim meetings with harsh lighting where we watched Tim Kaine snap. The Democrats weren’t a party then and wouldn’t be now.I realized that my malaise wasn’t just circumstantial. It was deeper. Sure, I could blame an out-of-control 24/7 news cycle. My iPhone’s constant alerts seemed able to bypass my brain and send stressful electrical signals directly to my spleen, kidney, sphincter. (The election’s very language had been of war, and dental surgery: “Battleground states!” “Crumbling firewall!” “Razor’s edge!”)But I had become a rat seeking pellets because my emotions seesawed with the polls. If you looked inside my soul, you would see only the tumbling numbers of Nate Silver’s calculator. I had placed my faith not in a higher power but in higher math. (FiveThirtyEight cited “regressive mean averages.” Coupled with my low-interest mortgage and high good cholesterol, everything would be fine!)I had no inner life, in short. I had to find some spirituality. So the Sunday after the election, I decided to go to church.I was raised a Lutheran (German mother). I had also sent my girls to Lutheran Sunday school. This was, admittedly, for convenience: The local Lutherans were known for their excellent day care; the looser Unitarian Universalists favored marches into tick-filled woods and drumming.Now a middle-aged Whole Foods Democrat, my Sunday mornings had drifted to coffee in bed while cheating my way through the crossword puzzle. (Strong in clues related to Yma Sumac or Leon Uris, I unapologetically check the internet for baseball teams, Lithuanian estuaries, rappers.) After that I might go to the farmers’ market to buy organic vegetables I will not cook, then fake my way through the easiest yoga class I can find.But that Sunday, I set off for All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, Calif.: long-established, famously liberal, robustly attended. Its stunning architecture, from the late 1800s, is Gothic Revival. (I immediately thought: “Game of Thrones” without the blood! Another vice? Too much HBO?)And here was the surprise. Like those people sculpting mashed potatoes in “Close Encounters,” it seemed other Whole Foods Democrats had been struck by the same idea. Shocked by the election, we thought we would all try the same daring new thing. Church! The incoming crowd soon became standing-room triple overflow, causing the initially smiling ushers to show concern, then almost irritation. Many of us newbies didn’t know what to do. We were practically asking: “Shoes or no shoes?” “Do you take Visa?” “Can you validate my parking?”My particular group packed into a side chamber and the entry procession began. To grand pipe-organ music, here was a satisfying pageant of colorful robes, golden staffs, vigorously waving flags. I glanced at the program and noticed that today’s Children’s Chorus song began:Let us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther King —I thought: Oh, it’s like that heartbreaking James Taylor song … then realized it was that heartbreaking James Taylor song, “Shed a Little Light.” I teared up. The apocalypse had come, but youths in all hues of literal and figurative rainbows were bravely persisting, in magical four-part harmony:And recognize that there are ties between us,All men and women living on the Earth.Ties of hope and love,Sister and brotherhood.There was a thunderous standing ovation. Now the Rev. Mike Kinman opened his sermon, with a Boomer-friendly reference: “John Lennon sang, ‘Nobody told me there would be days like these.’ But our Gospel does. ‘Strange days indeed.’”Because Episcopal liturgies are planned in a three-year cycle, it was by coincidence that the day’s reading was from Luke: “The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of the End Times.” How prophetic! Mr. Kinman described Christ as “a dark-skinned refugee who died for love with his hands up because he challenged the authority of a police state.” He denounced the president-elect by name. He thanked God for the election’s “mission clarification.” Another standing O, from God’s love army.The service was followed by a group-therapy session where a mike was passed and everyone described their feelings in three words. After that, I scanned the rich volunteer opportunities. I got so jazzed I think I signed up for building a mission in Bolivia and singing in a gay men’s chorus.Since that first Sunday, the “mission clarification” of these times has only intensified. I am stunned by every turn in the Drumpf administration in so many realms: health care, the protection of the environment, L.G.B.T. rights and the ever-burbling geopolitical turmoil. End Times? Who can know?But I am comforted by thinking maybe a Really Yuge Man is in charge. As in, God.So as President Drumpf’s 100th day approacheth, we celebrate Easter. I light a candle of forgiveness for Ohio. Hope rises from the dead, and our spring bonnets are sprouting jaunty pink knit ears. With validated parking.",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — Justice Neil M. Gorsuch is by all accounts the soul of courtesy, and he may have a hard time elbowing his way into the judicial crossfire that is the modern Supreme Court argument.Justices interrupt one another all the time, and it may not be easy for the new justice to find his place and to raise his voice this week, when he hears his first arguments.But a new study suggests that Justice Gorsuch has two things going for him: He is conservative, and he is male.“Conservatives interrupt liberals at significantly higher rates than liberals interrupt conservatives,” the study, to be published in The Virginia Law Review, found.And male justices, perhaps not surprisingly, interrupt female justices far more often than the other way around. “Even though female justices speak less often and use fewer words than male justices,” the study found, “they are nonetheless interrupted during oral argument at a significantly higher rate.”Tonja Jacobi, a law professor at Northwestern University who conducted the study with Dylan Schweers, a law student there, said the ideological disparity reflected the balance of power on the court.“Conservatives have dominated the court for the last 50 years, and, knowing that, they feel they are more in power than liberals feel,” Professor Jacobi said in an interview. “Interruptions are generally considered an aspect of dominance, and the conservatives feel dominant over the liberals. With Gorsuch entering the court, that’s going to reinforce that tendency.”Gender, the study concluded, plays an even larger role.The study considered 7,239 interruptions in arguments from 2004 to 2015. Of those, 32 percent were of women, and just 4 percent were by women.Studies in other settings have shown that men tend to assert their power by interrupting women. Still, it is telling that the phenomenon persists at the Supreme Court.“If female justices are consistently interrupted more than their male counterparts in this context,” the study said, “it would show that gender dynamics are so powerful to persist even in the face of high levels of power achieved by women.”Male lawyers also interrupt female justices more often than male ones. (Female lawyers, it seems, never interrupt anyone.)This is particularly surprising in light of the stern instructions the Supreme Court provides in a guide for lawyers preparing to argue before it.“Never interrupt a justice who is addressing you,” the guide says. “If you are speaking and a justice interrupts you, cease talking immediately and listen.”But such interruptions are not particularly unusual when male lawyers face questioning from female justices.In a 2015 argument in a big affirmative action case, a lawyer for a student challenging the University of Texas’ admissions program repeatedly interrupted Justice Sonia Sotomayor.“Let me finish my point,” Justice Sotomayor finally told the lawyer.The study had to grapple with one particularly contentious relationship. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who is both liberal and loquacious, seemed to have a special knack for getting under the skin of Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. “Scalia interrupted Breyer at such an extraordinary rate as to dwarf all other interruptions,” the study found.By comparison, Justice Scalia interrupted Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, another liberal, at just 15 percent of the rate at which he interrupted Justice Breyer.“If we subtract Scalia’s interruptions of Breyer, and vice versa,” the study said, “then the only three justices who are interrupted more than 100 times are Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan — the three female justices.” This is particularly telling, as Justice Elena Kagan did not join the court until 2010, and Justice Sotomayor joined it the year before.The two general trends — conservatives interrupting liberals, and men interrupting women — are hard to disentangle these days, as all three women on the court are liberals.The study addressed this overlap by looking at some older terms. In 1990, for instance, it found that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, a moderate conservative who was then the only woman on the court, was interrupted 2.8 times as often as the average male justice.That suggests that ideology and gender are independent factors. Between the two, Professor Jacobi said, gender seems to play the larger role. “And that’s pretty remarkable,” she said, “because ideology has been shown to influence everything in judicial behavior.”Seniority also figures in almost everything at the Supreme Court, and it may be that more senior justices feel entitled to interrupt more junior ones. Until Justice Gorsuch joined the court, the two most junior members were Justices Sotomayor and Kagan. But Professor Jacobi said the explanatory power of seniority was relatively minor. “Both gender and ideology are much more significant,” she said.I fear I interrupted Professor Jacobi to ask whether these trends tell us anything about how Justice Gorsuch is likely to act, given his mild and courteous manner.“If we know going in that he’s a conservative male,” she replied, “then we would think there’s a good chance that he would be an interrupter.”Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s behavior on the bench, she said, may provide a valuable comparison.“Chief Justice Roberts is a very polite man,” she said. “He seems to care about decorum. He cares about the reputation of the court. And he’s one of the biggest interrupters, interestingly. I see Gorsuch as somewhat similar in style to Roberts.”“I don’t think that a lot of men notice that they’re doing this,” Professor Jacobi said.",

      "text" : "A man on an overbooked United Airlines flight was forcibly removed from his seat and dragged through the aisle on Sunday, and video of the anguished protests by him and other passengers spread rapidly on Monday as people criticized the airline’s tactics.At least two passengers on the flight, which was scheduled to depart Chicago O’Hare for Louisville at 5:40 p.m. but was delayed two hours, documented the confrontation. Their videos show a police officer in plain clothes wrestling the man from his seat and dragging him by his arms, as his glasses slid down his face and his shirt rose above his midriff. Uniformed officers follow.The man returned to the aircraft after being removed, according to one of the passengers. Video shows him jogging through the aisle, repeatedly saying: “I have to go home.”Charlie Hobart, a United spokesman, said in a telephone interview on Monday that “we had asked several times, politely” for the man to relinquish his seat before force was used.“We had a customer who refused to leave the aircraft,” he said. “We have a number of customers on board that aircraft, and they want to get to their destination on time and safely, and we want to work to get them there.“Since that customer refused to leave the aircraft, we had to call the Chicago Police Department, and they came on board.”United first sought volunteers to relinquish their seats with compensation, but none stepped forward, he said. Four passengers were selected to be bumped, and three left without incident, Mr. Hobart said.He would not say whether the bumped passengers were chosen by a computer, human or some combination of the two. But factors can include how long a customer would have to stay at the airport before being rebooked, he said, and the airline looks to avoid separating families or leaving unaccompanied minors.“We explained the scenario to the customer,” Mr. Hobart said. “That customer chose not to get out of his seat.”In a statement, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive of United Airlines, called the episode “an upsetting event to all of us here at United.”“I apologize for having to re-accomodate these customers,” he said. “Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve this situation.”Three passengers — two on Twitter, one in an interview with the Louisville Courier-Journal — said the man was a doctor who had appointments to see patients on Monday morning, but that could not immediately be confirmed.Mr. Hobart referred questions about the man’s interaction with the police to the Chicago Police Department. A police spokeswoman directed queries to the Chicago Department of Aviation, which did not immediately return a call seeking comment.In a statement, United said “we apologize for the overbook situation.”Airlines routinely sell tickets to more people than the plane can seat, counting on several people not to arrive. When there aren’t enough no-shows, airlines first try to offer rewards to customers willing to reschedule their plans, usually in the form of travel vouchers, gift cards or cash.The arrangement can be lucrative to flexible travelers. A woman said she made $11,000 from Delta this weekend by twice delaying a family trip to Florida with her husband and daughter, then ultimately canceling it.The episode on Sunday was the second social media stir for United in two weeks. In March, two girls were barred from a flight because they were wearing leggings, which the company said violated its dress code for a company benefit of United employees and their dependents. Critics called it a sexist and overbearing policy.",

      "text" : "NASHVILLE — In the world of apostolic betrayals, it’s Judas who gets the headlines, but the everyday believer is more apt to fall in line behind Peter. Coldly handing Jesus over to his death in exchange for 30 pieces of silver was an over-the-top, cartoon-level move, but Peter’s terrified denial of the man he believed to be the savior of the world? That one seems immensely human to me.I have a lot of sympathy for Peter these days. Here it is nearly Easter, and for the first time in my life I don’t want anyone to know I’m a believer. To many, “Christian” has become synonymous with angry white voters in red hats, personally responsible for handcuffing all those undocumented mothers and wrenching them out of their sobbing children’s arms.A good number of Southern Christians tend to vote Republican, but in truth the values of the rural South are not incompatible with the policies of the Democratic Party. Our famed Southern hospitality is just an illustration of Jesus’ exhortation to welcome the stranger. And consider what happens here whenever there’s a flood or a tornado: Long before the government agencies mobilize, local churches are taking up donations, cooking hot meals, helping people pick through the wreckage — helping everyone, no matter their religion or the color of their skin or the language they speak at home.But as with a lot of people, including secular liberals, the way Christians behave as human beings can be completely at odds with the way they vote. Decades ago, when I was still a teenager in Alabama, I heard my grandmother refer to some new neighbors as the Tallyho Boys. Turns out a gay couple had bought or inherited a farm just down the road from her. The good ladies of that rural community welcomed the couple with poundcakes and homemade jelly, but would they have voted for a political candidate who supported marriage equality? Not a chance.Partly this divide comes down to scale: You can love a human being and still fear the group that person belongs to. A friend of mine recently joined a continuing-ed class made up about equally of native-born Americans and immigrants. The two groups integrate seamlessly, joking around like any co-workers, but the day after the election my friend said, “I think half my class might’ve just voted to deport the other half.”Tribal bonds have always been a challenge for our species. What’s new is how baldly the 2016 election exposed the collision between basic Christian values and Republican Party loyalty. By any conceivable definition, the sitting president of the United States is the utter antithesis of Christian values — a misogynist who disdains refugees, persecutes immigrants, condones torture and is energetically working to dismantle the safety net that protects our most vulnerable neighbors. Watching Christians put him in the White House has completely broken my heart.My husband and I are cradle Catholics, but my husband’s aunt used to refer to us as “cafeteria Catholics,” picking and choosing what we believe. Belonging to a community, feeling at home in the liturgy, carrying on a long family tradition — all these intangibles made it easy enough, before the election, to ignore much of what the church gets wrong and concentrate on what it gets right: supporting open immigration, welcoming refugees, opposing capital punishment, housing the homeless, feeding the hungry, caring for the sick and the aged and the lonely. Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” All the rest is window dressing.But this is the part of Christ’s message that most conservative Christians ignore when they step into the voting booth. In part that’s because abortion has become the ultimate border wall for Southern believers. I can’t count the number of Christians I know who are one-plank voters: They’d put Vladimir Putin in the White House if he promised to overturn Roe v. Wade. To someone who ardently believes abortion is murder, that idea is not as crazy as it seems. But reasonable people can disagree on the moment when human life begins, and I don’t see my own commitment to protecting a woman’s legal right to choose as a contradiction of my religious practice. No matter how you define it, protecting human life should never stop at the zygote.Republicans now have what they’ve long wanted: the chance to turn this into a Christian nation. But what’s being planned in Washington will hit my fellow Southerners harder than almost anyone else. Where are the immigrants? Mostly in the South. Which states execute more prisoners? The Southern states. Which region has the highest poverty rates? The South. Where are you most likely to drink poisoned water? Right here in the South. Where is affordable health care hardest to find? You guessed it. My people are among the least prepared to survive a Trump presidency, but the “Christian” president they elected is about to demonstrate exactly what betrayal really looks like — and for a lot more than 30 pieces of silver.Liberal Christians in the South are by definition a lonely bunch, different from conservative Christians at home and different from secular liberals everywhere else. Still, I have never felt lonelier than I feel in Donald Trump’s America.But I also believe in resurrection. Every day brings word of a new Trump-inflicted human-rights calamity, and every day a resistance is growing that I would not have imagined possible, a coalition of people on the left and the right who have never before seen themselves as allies. In working together, I hope we’ll end up with something that looks a lot like a Christian nation — not in doctrine but in practice, caring for the least among us and loving our neighbors as ourselves.",

      "text" : "We’ve got a whole roundup of 2017’s tech April Fools’ pranks, but this one from Snapchat deserves a little highlight all its own.Back in August of last year, Instagram copied Snapchat’s Stories feature. There’s no arguing it. Instagram’s CEO even says Snapchat deserves credit for “this format.” They didn’t even bother changing the name — Instagram’s version of Snapchat Stories is just called “Instagram Stories.”\nSo for April Fools’ Day, Snapchat ripped them off in return — albeit in a less obvious way. They’ve turned Instagram’s interface into a Snapchat filter for the day and just swapped out “Instagram” for “Snapchat” up at the top. It’s a filter, rather than a lens, so it’s something you apply after taking a photo. Snap a photo in Snapchat, then swipe to the side a few times — about 10 swipes in, a familiar interface should slide into place.\n(Bonus points for the little burn implying that the world’s collective “mom” is one of the only people looking at your photos there.)\n[hat tip to Owen Williams for noticing this super quick]",

      "text" : "Passenger is dragged off an overbooked flight Embed Copy Share Play Video0:28 United Airlines said a man wouldn't give up his spot on an overbooked flight. According to witnesses, he was pulled screaming from his seat by security and back to the terminal at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. (Tyler Bridges) United Airlines said a man wouldn’t give up his spot on an overbooked flight. According to witnesses, he was pulled screaming from his seat by security and back to the terminal at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. United Airlines said a man wouldn’t give up his spot on an overbooked flight. According to witnesses, he was pulled screaming from his seat by security and back to the terminal at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. (Tyler Bridges) United Airlines says a man wouldn’t give up his spot on an overbooked flight Sunday. So, according to witnesses and videos of the incident, he was pulled screaming from his seat by security, knocked against an arm rest and dragged down the aisle and back to the terminal at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. United refused to answer questions about the incident, which horrified other passengers on the Louisville-bound flight. An airline spokesman only apologized for the overbooked flight, and said police were called after a passenger “refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily.” What happened was captured on cellphone video by at least two passengers. Tyler Bridges recalled trouble starting almost as soon as he and his wife boarded. An airline supervisor walked onto the plane and brusquely announced: “We have United employees that need to fly to Louisville tonight. … This flight’s not leaving until four people get off.” “That rubbed some people the wrong way,” Bridges said. [A United pilot ranted about Drumpf, Clinton and divorce. Her passengers fled.] Passengers were offered vouchers to rebook, he said, but no one volunteered. So the airline chose for them. A young couple was told to leave first, Bridges recalled. “They begrudgingly got up and left,” he said. Then an older man, who refused. “He says, ‘Nope. I’m not getting off the flight. I’m a doctor and have to see patients tomorrow morning,'” Bridges said. The man became angry as the manager persisted, Bridges said, eventually yelling. “He said, more or less, ‘I’m being selected because I’m Chinese.'” A police officer boarded. Then a second and a third. Bridges then began recording, as did another passenger — as the officers leaned over the man, a lone holdout in his window seat. @United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane. Here's how they did it: pic.twitter.com/QfefM8X2cW — Jayse D. Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017 “Can’t they rent a car for the pilots?” another passenger asks in the videos. Then the man, out of frame, screams. One of the officers quickly reaches across two empty seats, snatches the man and pulls him into the aisle. “My God!” someone yells — not for the first time. He goes limp after hitting the floor. @WHAS11 It looked like he was knocked out, because he went limp and quiet and they dragged him out of the plane like a rag doll. — Jayse D. Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017 “It looked like it knocked him out,” Bridges said. “His nose was bloody.” His glasses nearly knocked off his face, the man clutches his cellphone as one of the officers pulls him by both arms down the aisle and off the plane. “This is horrible,” someone says. “What are you doing? No! This is wrong.” And with that, Bridges said, four United employees boarded and took the empty seats. [‘Don’t put your hands on my flight attendant,’ heroic pilot yells before tackling passenger] They were not popular among the passengers, he recalled. “People were saying you should be ashamed to work for this company,” Bridges said. And it wasn’t over. @WHAS11 10mins later, the doctor runs back into the plane with a bloody face, clings to a post in the back, chanting, \"I need to go home.\" — Jayse D. Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017 In another video, the man runs back onto the plane, his clothes still mussed from his forcible ejection, frantically repeating: “I have to go home. I have to go home.” “He was kind of dazed and confused,” Bridges said.

      "text" : "UPDATED: You can now hear this essay read by the actress Kathryn Hahn in Modern Love: The Podcast. Look for the “play” button below or subscribe on iTunes or Google Play Music.While away at a conference in Minneapolis, I was awakened at dawn by a call from my husband in our New York apartment. Our 8-year-old son had just roused him with the suspicion that they might not make their 7:30 a.m. flight to join me because it was now 7:40 and they were still at home.The original plan had us all traveling to Minneapolis together. I would attend my conference, my musician husband would do a show at this cool club, and our son would get hotel pool time: a triple win.Then my husband was offered a great gig in New York for the same day we were set to leave, so he called to change his and our son’s tickets. Changing them, he learned, was going to cost more than buying a new pair of one-way tickets out. So he did that instead, planning to use their original return tickets, not realizing that if you don’t use the first leg, they cancel the second. That meant buying new return tickets at a cost somewhere between “Ugh” and “What have you done?”Now, after all that, my family had missed the first leg of the new itinerary. On hold with the airline yet again, my husband was texting me sexy emojis.“Focus,” I replied, with an emoji of an airplane.He sent me an emoji of a flan.He and I married young for our urban friend group — in our late 20s — and now, in our late 30s, we find ourselves attending the weddings of peers. My husband of 11 years and I sit at these weddings listening to our in-thrall friends describe all the ways in which they will excel at being married.“I will always be your best friend,” they say, reading from wrinkled pieces of paper held in shaking hands. “I will never let you down.”I clap along with everyone else; I love weddings. Still, there is so much I want to say.I want to say that one day you and your husband will fight about missed flights, and you’ll find yourself wistful for the days when you had to pay for only your own mistakes. I want to say that at various points in your marriage, may it last forever, you will look at this person and feel only rage. You will gaze at this man you once adored and think, “It sure would be nice to have this whole place to myself.”In Zen Buddhism, meditation helps practitioners detach from the cycle of desire and suffering. In my brief stint as a religious studies major, I preferred Pure Land Buddhism, an alternate path to enlightenment for people who (as one professor told us) may find it difficult to abandon worldly pain and passion because those things can also yield such beauty and comfort. He summed it up as: “Life is suffering — and yet.”I think about that all the time: “And yet.” Such hedging, to me, is good religion and also the key to a successful marriage. In the course of being together forever, you come across so many “and yets,” only some of them involving domestic air travel.I love this person, and yet she’s such a mess. And yet when I’m sick, he’s not very nurturing. And yet we don’t want the same number of children. And yet I sometimes wonder what it would be like to be single again.The longer you are with someone, the more big and little “and yets” rack up. You love this person. Of course you plan to be with him or her forever. And yet forever can begin to seem like a long time. Breaking up and starting fresh, which everyone around you seems to be doing, can begin to look like a wonderful and altogether logical proposition.But “and yet” works the other way, too. Even during the darkest moments of my own marriage, I have had these nagging exceptions. And yet, we still make each other laugh. And yet, he is still my person. And yet, I still love him.And so you don’t break up, and you outlast some more of your friends’ marriages.“The way to stay married,” my mother says, “is not to get divorced.”“My parents were too poor to get divorced,” a friend told me that very day in Minneapolis as we walked through the book fair. “And so they stayed married and then it seemed too late, and now they’re glad.”Those are the things I think about when yet another person I used to think of as being part of a happily married couple messages a friend of mine on Tinder.Later that morning, while waiting to hear from my husband about the flights, I decided to kill time looking at houses on Trulia’s “Near Me.” When I used to travel alone as a teenager, I would stare at houses wherever I was and imagine what it would be like to live there. Now I still do that, but I can also call up Trulia on my phone and see how much they cost.Comparing houses in Minneapolis, I found I actually preferred the cheaper, more ramshackle, family-friendly ones, like a two-bedroom that had “classic old world charm.” Hardwood floors! A built-in buffet! So much better, really, than the pricier one-bedroom I would live in as a single person on the other side of Powderhorn Park, with its new ceiling fans, three cedar closets and breakfast nook.What would I even do with three cedar closets?Meanwhile, still no word from my husband about the flights.One thing I love about marriage (and I love a lot of things about marriage) is that you can have a bad day or even a bad few years, full of doubt and fights and confusion and storming out of the house. But as long as you don’t get divorced, you are no less married than couples who never have a hint of trouble (I am told such people exist).You can be bad at a religion and still be 100 percent that religion. Just because you take the Lord’s name in vain doesn’t make you suddenly a non-Christian. You can be a sinner. In fact, I think it’s good theology that no matter how hard you try, you are sure to be a sinner, just as you are sure to be lousy, at least sometimes, at being married. There is perfection only in death.It is easy for people who have never tried to do anything as strange and difficult as being married to say marriage doesn’t matter, or to condemn those who fail at it, or to mock those who even try. But there is so much beauty in the trying, and in the failing, and in the trying again. Peter renounced Jesus three times before the cock crowed. And yet, he was the rock upon whom Christ built his church.At weddings, I do not contradict my beaming newlywed friends when they talk about how they will gracefully succeed where nearly everyone in human history has floundered. I only wish I could tell them they will suffer occasionally in this marriage — and not only sitcom-grade squabbles, but possibly even dark-night-of-the-soul despair.That doesn’t mean they are doomed to divorce, just that it’s unlikely they will be each other’s best friend every single minute forever. And that while it’s good to aim high, it’s quite probable they will let each other down many times in ways both petty and profound that in this blissful moment they can’t even fathom.But I would go on to say (had I not by that point been thrown out of the banquet hall): Epic failure is part of being human, and it’s definitely part of being married. It’s part of what being alive means, occasionally screwing up in expensive ways. And that’s part of what marriage means, sometimes hating this other person but staying together because you promised you would. And then, days or weeks later, waking up and loving him again, loving him still.Finally, nearly two hours after my husband’s original flight left, I texted him to ask if he was still on hold.“We just got in a cab,” he replied. “Flying Air Wisconsin, baby!”“Did you have to pay for the tickets again?” I texted.The phone was silent. In that quiet moment, sitting in my hotel room, I found myself daydreaming about the one-bedroom apartment looking out onto Powderhorn Park. After waking up alone, I would brew some coffee, switch on one of my many ceiling fans, grab a robe from my largest cedar closet and head for my breakfast nook.“Nope,” he wrote back.And suddenly I was back in the bigger place on the cheaper side of the park. My family was coming to join me. And I was glad.",

      "text" : "Trump: NATO is ‘no longer obsolete’ Embed Copy Share Play Video1:07 During a joint news conference with North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, April 12, President Trump said NATO is \"no longer obsolete.\" (The Washington Post) During a joint news conference with North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, April 12, President Trump said NATO is “no longer obsolete.” During a joint news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, President Trump says NATO is “no longer obsolete.” (The Washington Post) President Trump on Wednesday pledged his full support to NATO, reaffirming the United States' commitment to the alliance and saying he no longer considers it “obsolete,” a sharp reversal from his rhetoric on the campaign trail and during his first weeks in office. On a day when Trump dramatically changed his stance on several policy positions, his statement about NATO stood out given his consistent criticism of the military alliance and its importance to U.S. allies. For more than a year, Trump has said NATO is outdated and costing the United States too much money, suggesting replacing it with an alternative organization focused on counterterrorism and repeatedly using the word “obsolete.” As recently as January, Trump continued to stand by this position — which alarmed many NATO members — saying in a Jan. 15 interview with the Times of London and Germany’s Bild that NATO is “obsolete because it wasn’t taking care of terror” and that critics of his comments have “started saying Trump is right.” During a joint news conference Wednesday afternoon with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump professed that his criticisms prompted the alliance to make changes that satisfied his concerns--though he did not specify what those were. “I complained about that a long time ago, and they made a change — and now they do fight terrorism,” Trump said. “I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete.” It's unclear what changes the president was referencing. NATO added a new assistant secretary general position focused on intelligence and security in July, although experts say the change does not mark a major shift for the organization and point out that NATO has long addressed concerns of terrorism. For months after the position was created, Trump continued to call NATO obsolete. Stoltenberg told the president he was “right,” but described the change in far different terms. “We have established a new division for intelligence, which enhances our ability to fight terrorism, and working together in the alliance to fight terrorism in an even more effective way,” Stoltenberg said. “But we agreed today, you and I, that NATO can and must do more in the global fight against terrorism.” Despite his campaign rhetoric, Trump and his aides have steadily offered support for NATO since he took office. The president has committed to attending a meeting of the NATO countries on May 25 in Brussels during his first foreign trip, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attended meetings of the alliance in late March. In brief remarks, Trump again called on NATO members to “meet their financial obligations and pay what they owe,” noting that member-nations are expected to contribute 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense. Stoltenberg confirmed that ensuring the cost burden is better shared among countries has become a top priority for him. politics post-politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set! See all newsletters Later, Trump said he asked Stoltenberg to look into collecting back-dues from countries, something that Stoltenberg did not verbally agree to do. Trump has consistently misrepresented the financial obligations of NATO members, saying they “owe vast sums” in dues and the situation is unfair to the United States. NATO members do not owe dues or back payments. Trump also thanked NATO members for condemning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons and “the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies.” At one point, Trump referred to the Syrian leader as a “butcher.” On Wednesday, Trump backed away from several other firm positions that he had held for months on the campaign trail. Early in the day, the government ended a federal government hiring freeze that Trump had promised to institute, although departments have been told to find other ways to shrink staff sizes. Then, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the president announced he no longer considers China a currency manipulator, he now supports lower interest rates and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and he would consider renominating Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen when her tenure is up next year, despite saying on the campaign trail he would “most likely” not reappoint her. Last week, Trump abandoned his longtime stance that the United States should not get involved with Syria when he approved a strike on an airbase there. “I felt we had to do something about it,” Trump said Wednesday of the Syria bombing. “I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing. And it was very, very successfully done, as you well know.”",

      "text" : "Subscribe to The Atlantic’s Politics & Policy Daily, a roundup of ideas and events in American politics. Updated at 6:46 p.m. ETIt’s only been a few months, but it feels like forever ago that Steve Bannon told New York Magazine that he had “bonded” with Jared Kushner, who “really gets this grassroots, populist movement in a huge way.”Now, the two men are at odds in an escalating conflict that might seem like just the latest twist in the constant palace intrigue emanating from the White House. But this clash, which threatens Bannon’s position and could further cement Kushner’s increasingly broad influence, has importance beyond the sort of petty infighting that afflicts any administration. For Trump supporters, this is a battle between the populist nationalist movement on the right, for which Trump is a figurehead, and the more pragmatic, less ideological approach exhibited by Kushner and his allies. The result could determine whether the Trump White House stays, well, Trumpian, or whether it begins to morph into exactly what someone like Steve Bannon hates: a more mainstream Republican administration. Latest from Politics The Atlantic Politics & Policy Daily: Slow Nunes Day Bannon, who was removed from the National Security Council principals’ committee on Wednesday, has been at odds with Kushner, who has been taking on more and more responsibility in the White House across a broad range of issues. Politico reported that Bannon threatened to quit if he was removed from the NSC. The Daily Beast reported that Bannon has called Kushner a “cuck” and a “globalist” behind his back. (A source close to Bannon insisted they had never heard Bannon use the term “cuck” in any context.) Bannon has been warning of a “gunfight,” Axios reported.According to a senior White House official, Bannon and Kushner “disagree on everything on policy.”“Jared is a liberal Democrat,” the official said, accusing Kushner of trying to limit the role of some in Trump’s orbit—including Bannon, policy aide Stephen Miller, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Domestic Policy Council Director Andrew Bremberg, and Vice President Mike Pence—in making policy. Kushner, the official charged, is trying to “slow-walk” executive orders on trade, for example.In response to the official's accusations against Kushner, White House director of strategic communications Hope Hicks said \"The information your source provided you is not accurate.\"Bannon told me reports that he was threatening to quit were “absurd.”But it’s hard to spin the reality of this White House, which is that people like Kushner and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, whose predecessor Michael Flynn resigned after lying about his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, are growing in influence after a turbulent first three months. During that time, Bannon and his allies like Miller have shouldered the blame for some of the administration’s biggest setbacks, like the initial travel ban executive order that was quickly overturned in the federal courts. Kushner recently became charged with a new office tasked with streamlining the government, called the Office of American Innovation, and Bannon’s removal from the NSC principals’ committee was widely interpreted as a win for McMaster.“The bottom line on the thing is it’s real, it’s absolutely real,” a Bannon ally outside the White House said of the conflict between Bannon and Kushner, adding that the anti-Bannon forces include not just Kushner, but top economic adviser Gary Cohn and Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell as well.“Definitely tensions, nothing resolved,” said a source close to Trump, in an email. There are “attempts to clearly define roles. Potus now is engaged in resolving the issues if they can be resolved.”“Jared just doesn’t think that Trump will be successful with somebody like Bannon in there,” said one source close to the White House. “I know, for instance, that there have been meetings that Bannon would normally be in and he hasn’t been in recently.”Bannon was conspicuously absent from Trump’s joint press conference with the King of Jordan in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. Six top aides sat in on Trump’s interview with The New York Times this week, including Cohn, but Bannon was not listed among them in the transcript of the interview.“I think he is in trouble,” said another source with knowledge of the internal workings of the White House. “I think Jared is moving on him.”“For whatever reason Bannon seems to be allied with Reince, and Bannon seems to be opposed by Jared,” the source said.The issue—as my colleague Conor Friedersdorf pointed out today—appears to be at least partially about image. Kushner and Ivanka Trump have carefully managed their brand in the media, and Bannon’s hard-edged nationalism threatens their smooth public personae.“I’m sure Jared and Ivanka are very embarrassed by Steve’s politics,” the source with inside knowledge of the White House said. “I know they’re not fashionable in Manhattan but those are the politics that got Trump elected. Clearly Jared wants the president to be a more mainstream political figure.”This line is being amplified in pro-Trump media. Longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone went on conspiracy-theory network Infowars this week to accuse Kushner of leaking anti-Bannon stories to MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough. Breitbart News, the right-wing nationalist outlet formerly run by Bannon, has published a string of stories critical of Kushner in the last few days, accusing him of having a “thin resume in diplomacy” and writing up Stone’s accusations.“Bannon out. Nunes out. Flynn out. Sessions recused,” conservative writer Ann Coulter, a leading Trump supporter, wrote on Twitter. “We won WH & both houses! Imagine if we lost. GOP would be picking up Dems dry cleaning.”For now, the situation remains unresolved. Bannon, for example, is among the senior staff traveling with Trump on Air Force One today.But his predicament speaks to a dynamic within this White House that has thus far proved unshakeable: You can’t bet against the family. And it speaks to a truth about Washington, which is that the establishment always seems to find a way to reassert itself—even in as unusual an environment as Trump’s White House.“If the Trump administration becomes a pale copy of the Bush administration,” the source with inside knowledge of the White House said, “then there was no reason for this election.”",

      "text" : "Getty The AgendaIs the territory the next D.C., or the next Greece? By Danny Vinik 04/04/16 06:46 AM EDTIs Washington about to take over Puerto Rico?The territory’s dire financial crisis took a step toward resolution last week when the House Natural Resources Committee released a draft plan to give the federal government an extraordinary new power: a five-member oversight board that could enact laws and regulations over the objections of Puerto Rico’s own elected officials.Though such boards are used at times by states to rescue a troubled city, it’s an unusual move for Washington, and the financial firms that hold Puerto Rican bonds are spooked: the proposed board would also have authority to allow the island to restructure its $72 billion debt, which could cost the bondholders significant money. In defense of the plan, supporters point to a successful example from two decades ago. In 1995, Congress imposed a control board on Washington, D.C., after it faced a budget crisis of its own. It took a few years to get the city back on its feet, but today the move is widely considered a success.“It’s a great analogy,” said former Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.) who chaired the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over D.C. until 2000. He added, “The city’s a miracle when you go back 20 years and look at what it was.”But critics say that this analogy misses the mark, and that Puerto Rico and D.C. are different enough that the Puerto Rico move would be genuinely unprecedented—and risks undermining political support for the difficult policy decisions the island must make to reverse its economic crisis.“It’s easy to say that you should go in and tell them what to do and they can do it,” said Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the IMF who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “It’s very, very hard to make that work in a place that has a strong sense of independence.”In 1995, the District of Columbia faced a $722 million deficit on a $3.2 billion budget. It was bordering on insolvency and desperate for financial help from the federal government. Instead, the feds took control. The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act allowed then-President Bill Clinton to appoint a five-member financial control board that would have wide authority over the District’s budget and the ability to overrule then-mayor Marion Barry, who called the move a “rape of democracy” and “bloodless coup.” The board would exist until D.C. balanced its budget four years in a row.The D.C. control board quickly made a number of reforms to close the budget deficit. It reduced the city’s workforce by thousands, reformed the city’s relationship with the federal government to reduce the financial burden on the District and implemented stronger financial management controls. By the 1998 fiscal year, the deficit was gone and it stayed that way for the next three years. On September 30, 2001, the board suspended its activities. Even Barry was impressed with the results, telling the Washington Post in 2011, “It was able to do some things that needed to be done that, politically, I would not do, would not do, would not do.”The comparison between D.C. and Puerto Rico, in one sense, seems reasonable. Both are part of the United States, but overseen directly by Congress rather than within the structure of a normal state. They both lack representation on Capitol Hill.But, critics argue, that’s where the similarities end. It makes a certain sense for Congress to impose a tight rein on D.C.: Many D.C. residents work within the federal government or interact with it on a daily basis and Congress already retains control over certain powers of government, including the ability to overturn any D.C. law. Not so Puerto Rico. Washington, D.C. is more than 1,500 miles from Puerto Rico’s capital, San Juan, and Puerto Rico’s population is more than five times as large. Asking Congress to take control of an area so far away invites civil unrest as unelected officials parachute in and impose harmful policies to solve the economic crisis. “D.C. was much more intertwined with the federal government [than Puerto Rico is],” Johnson said. They also are treated differently under the law. For instance, D.C. residents are eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Puerto Ricans are not. In a sense, Washington operates like a normal American city whose state governor happens to be Congress. But Puerto Rico is not like either a city or a state. It has many of the same responsibilities as a state, but lacks any representation in Congress. And while D.C.’s crisis was mostly limited to negative annual operating balances, Puerto Rico’s is more like a sovereign debt crisis, said Alice Rivlin, who was the chair of the D.C. control board from 1998 to 2001 and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Puerto Rico’s debt has risen to $72 billion, equal to nearly 70 percent of the island’s GDP, a far higher debt-to-GDP ratio than any other state. Already, Puerto Rico has defaulted on minor amounts of the debt. But unlike states, the island’s municipalities cannot declare bankruptcy through Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code, leaving it with little leverage to negotiate a voluntary restructuring of its debt with its creditors.To those creditors, the draft financial plan is major threat to their leverage. The proposal would allow the control board to mediate negotiations between Puerto Rico’s government and creditors and if the board deemed it necessary, to facilitate a court sanctioned restructuring. Such a restructuring would apply to all of Puerto Rico’s debt—what creditors are calling Super Chapter 9. The draft also proposes a stay for all debt litigation upon enactment.The government faces a $422 million debt payment on May 1 and another $2 billion payment on July 1, and it is unclear whether it has the funds to pay either of them. That’s put increased pressure on Congress to come up with a solution. The Natural Resources Committee plans to hold a hearing on a final discussion draft the second week in April and proceed to a markup of the full legislation soon thereafter. The Senate is likely to move quickly as well.The big worry is that the Puerto Rican deal might start to resemble the fallout from the Greek financial crisis, where strict bailout requirements from the European Union and the IMF have fostered unrest in Greece amid complaints that Europe is undermining its sovereignty. Puerto Rico’s situation isn’t quite the same—it’s not its own country, and isn’t seeking a bailout—but critics say the European experience demonstrates the need to have buy-in from the local population. And that buy-in is premised on allowing elected, democratically-accountable leaders to make the final policy decisions.“Contrary to D.C., which is a city, in dealing with Puerto Rico, you would have to assume that you’re dealing with Connecticut,” said Luis Fortuno, a former governor of Puerto Rico. “And the question that should be asked is whether this level of attention to every single detail would work in Connecticut or not? And I would say probably not.”Even opponents of the discussion draft believe that some form of a board is necessary for Puerto Rico. One recent poll found that 71 percent of Puerto Ricans favor an oversight board. But the details of the control board are important. Pedro Pierluisi, the island’s non-voting representative in Congress who supports the concept of an oversight board, has said that the current requirement that Puerto Rico achieve five consecutive balanced budgets before the board terminates is too many. He suggests three years instead. Furthermore, both critics and opponents of the discussion draft agree that the board should be made up of people who have a deep familiarity with Puerto Rico.“You want to make sure that these are done by Puerto Ricans and people with a nexus to the area,” said Davis.But there is no agreement over the control board’s authority. The ultimate question is whether it should have an advisory role—or have the power in this week’s proposal: the ability to override the elected public officials of Puerto Rico.“When you have a group that has presided over financial disaster, what has to happen is control is taken away from them and put in the hands of responsible people,” said Alex Pollock, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute who testified before Congress about a control board for Puerto Rico. “It does not mean that all will be a lovefest and wine and roses—almost certainly not.

Angelo Colon-Ortiz of Worcester, Mass., was charged Friday with aggravated assault, aggravated assault and battery and assault with intent to rape. Mr. Early said more charges are expected.The body of 27-year-old Ms. Marcotte was found Aug. 7, 2016, in some woods about a half-mile from her mother's house, where the young woman was visiting family. Ms. Marcotte, who worked as an account manager for Alphabet Inc.’s Google in New York, had gone out to run several hours earlier.Police said throughout the investigation they believed Ms. Marcotte fought her attacker and the suspect had scratches on his face, neck and arms. On Saturday, Mr. Early said DNA taken from Ms. Marcotte's hands during an autopsy helped solve the case. The DNA was used to help create a profile of a suspect, which was released two months ago. It also matched the DNA of Mr. Colon-Ortiz, 31, who police believe was working in the area at the time of the attack.The district attorney said “an alert state trooper assigned to the detective unit” recently spotted a dark SUV, the type of vehicle witnesses reported seeing in the area. Mr. Early said the trooper also noticed the driver matched the suspect’s profile, which determined the suspect in Ms. Marcotte's killing was a Hispanic or Latino man, about 30 years old, with light- to medium-toned skin, an athletic build and is either balding or has short hair.Mr. Early said the trooper looked up the vehicle’s license-plate number and left a business card at Mr. Colon-Ortiz’s home, asking him to call. When Mr. Colon-Ortiz didn’t respond, the trooper later returned to the home and obtained a voluntary DNA sample from Mr. Colon-Ortiz. That sample was determined to be a match on Friday, and Mr. Colon-Ortiz was subsequently arrested.He was being held Saturday at the state police barracks in Millbury, Mass., on a $10 million bond and is scheduled to appear in Leominster District Court on Tuesday. Mr. Early said Mr. Colon-Ortiz, who speaks limited English, has requested an attorney.—Copyright 2017 The Associated Press Sign Out WSJ MembershipCustomer ServiceTools & FeaturesAdsMore",

      "text" : "CNN's Jim Acosta on Wednesday sparred with Breitbart reporter Charlie Spiering over their employers’ coverage of President Trump.Spiering accused CNN of bias against the administration, and Acosta responded by asking why Breitbart invariably defended questionable or false statements made by Trump.\"[CNN] takes a completely hostile tone towards the president,” Spiering said at a journalism forum at the Newseum in Washington. “When it comes to people like [Obama national security adviser] Susan Rice, they are not taking the same tone of hostility. And a lot of the news they publish on that, I think a lot of our readers see that as coming from one side.“They are getting more of their talking points, a good portion of their sources from their Democratic friends. They didn’t vote for the president, and I think there is a difference in tone coming from the mainstream media vs. Breitbart.”Acosta answered Spiering's charge with a series of questions about Breitbart’s coverage of the administration. “Do you think when the president originally tweeted that ‘Barack ObamaBarack ObamaTrump reinforces turnaround on Syria and Russia Trump on North Korea-China relations: 'I realized it's not so easy' Trump campaigned on coal and has governed in climate denial MORE wiretapped me at Trump Tower. It’s like McCarthy. It’s like Watergate’ — do you think in the back of his mind he was thinking, ‘Oh yeah, Susan Rice, she unmasked some people and that’s what I really meant when I tweeted that’?” Acosta asked. “My question is, why can’t the folks on the conservative side of the news media just see the facts as they are? I mean, don’t you agree, Charlie, that those tweet on their face are just wrong? The president was not wiretapped at Trump Tower by Barack Obama?”Spiering responded by stating there was an “element of truth” in the president’s tweets.“We’re not talking about an element of truth,” Acosta interrupted. “How about just the truth? Why can’t we just have the truth? That’s my question.”Attendees of the event loudly applauded Acosta's remarks. Spiering responded that Breitbart readers and Trump supporters are \"very sick of\" the press being too friendly with those they cover. \"I think the sort of 'go along, get along, everyone gets along’ climate in Washington, D.C., is what a lot of Americans are tired of,” he said. “They’re tired of the closeness of the news media with the officials they cover. They’re tired of the stories of everybody hanging out and going out to dinners and partying and they’re tired of their issues.”The Associated Press's Julie Pace jumped in to note reporters have dinners with members of both political parties. \"That happens with Republicans and Democrats too, to be fair. I mean it’s not as though reporters are hanging out with only Democrats. We have dinners and lunches and coffees with Republicans as well,” she said.\"Right, but it’s part of the establishment,\" Spiering responded. \"It’s part of the swamp that, you know, the Trump supporters were very sick of.\" The Newseum event, billed \"The President and the Press,\" attracted big names from the administration and media, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer, senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, Fox News anchor Bret Baier, New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush, NBC's Kristen Welker, ABC's Cecilia Vega, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer and Jennifer Palmieri, the former communications director for Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonIf Ivanka Trump was a Democrat's kid, the media would worship her Inside a NJ Republican's furious town hall Report: After leaving campaign, Manafort borrowed millions from Trump-tied businesses MORE's 2016 presidential campaign.

We’re losing our shirt.”Despite Trump’s suggestion that Saudi Arabia should cough up more cash, the State Department last month approved resuming arms sales to Saudi Arabia which was previously blocked by Barack Obama.Last year, Obama’s administration approved a $1.15bn sale of tanks and armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, but due to the ongoing bombardment of Yemen by Saudi led forces, the former US president blocked the sale.Until now, Trump and his team have primarily focused on getting all NATO members to pay their \"fair share\" for their protection. The US is the biggest contributor to NATO’s defense expenditures, spending roughly two and a half times more than the rest of the allies combined. The US spent an estimated $664 billion on defense last year.Only five out of 28 NATO nations are currently meeting the two percent of GDP spending mark demanded by Trump.

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vote-on-trumps-supreme-court-nominee-to-test-red-state-democratic-senators-1491134401WASHINGTON—Senate leaders sparred Sunday over this week’s coming vote on Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court, a battle that puts Democrats in red-leaning states in the position of choosing between a Republican-nominated judge and their own party’s wish to block President Donald Trump. On Monday, the 20-member Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote largely along party lines to send Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to the Senate floor. That will intensify the scrambling for votes on both sides ahead of the full Senate’s consideration later in the week.Judge Gorsuch needs 60 votes to clear a procedural hurdle in the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 seats. If Republicans can’t secure the necessary eight Democratic votes, they have threatened to change Senate rules so they can confirm him—and future high-court justices—with a simple majority. One party forcing a change to the chamber’s rules is referred to as the “nuclear option.”“We’re going to get Judge Gorsuch confirmed,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said on Fox News Sunday. Asked if he is ready to change the Senate rules, Mr. McConnell said: “We’ll know through the course of the week,” adding: “It’s in the hands of Democrats.”The Senate Democrats’ leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said Republicans shouldn’t destroy the chamber’s precedent over high-court judges.“It looks like Gorsuch will not make the 60-vote margin,” Mr. Schumer said Sunday on NBC. “When a nominee doesn’t get 60 votes, you shouldn’t change the rules, you should change the nominee.”About three-dozen Democrats, outraged that Republicans refused even to hold a hearing last year for former President Barack Obama’s high-court nominee, have indicated they would vote to block Judge Gorsuch. Three Senate Democrats have said they would vote for him. Joe Donnelly of Indiana became the third Sunday, joining Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All three are from states Mr. Trump won easily and are up for re-election in 2018.Many senators from states that Mr. Trump carried more narrowly have pledged to block his court nominee, including Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.The approach of the red-state Democrats, who are dividing in the final week over how they will vote, will affect the course of the Gorsuch confirmation fight—especially whether Democrats can sustain a filibuster—and the Senate’s longtime reputation as one of the last remaining political arenas to compel bipartisan consensus.Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat up for re-election in 2018, comes from a state Mr. Trump won easily. At the same time, Mr. Trump’s presidency has unleashed a fierce backlash from liberal Democrats in Missouri and nationwide who are pressuring their elected officials to give no ground to the president. On Friday, Ms. McCaskill sided with the liberals and said she would oppose the nominee.“I am not comfortable with either choice,” Ms. McCaskill wrote in a Medium post Friday. “While I have come to the conclusion that I can’t support Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court—and will vote no on the procedural vote and his confirmation—I remain very worried about our polarized politics and what the future will bring, since I’m certain we will have a Senate rule change that will usher in more extreme judges in the future.”On Sunday evening, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana also said he would vote against Mr. Gorsuch.In 2013, when Democrats controlled the chamber, they changed rules to enable cabinet appointments and lower judicial nominees to be confirmed with just a simple majority, but they left in place the higher threshold for Supreme Court picks.If the Senate is able to confirm Supreme Court nominees with a simple majority, centrists in both parties fear that future presidents whose party also controls the Senate will have no incentive to pick a nominee aimed to garner bipartisan support.Presidents “will go to the extremes because the base will demand it and we’ll end up with a Supreme Court that has far more extreme justices on both sides of the aisle,” Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) said last week.Senate Democrats wavering on Mr. Gorsuch have cited a similar argument in his favor.The “most unique political body in the world, the U.S. Senate, will be no more than a six-year term in the House, and I don’t think anyone wants to be here for that,” Mr. Manchin said shortly before he announced his support for Mr. Gorsuch. “I’m doing whatever I can to preserve the 60-vote rule.”Other Democrats have said voting to block Mr. Gorsuch is necessary, given his judicial record, and called on Republicans to not change the rules.“I got the feeling that he will vote against the little guy for the big corporations,” said Sen. Bill Nelson (D., Fla.).While Supreme Court fights in the Senate are nothing new, most presidents until recent years nominated at least one justice during their term who found little opposition. The last three nominees to be approved to the court—Justices Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan —drew several “no” votes but had no trouble getting past the filibuster threat. Democrats say the Republican roadblock of Mr. Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, escalated the partisan tensions over the high court.Liberal groups, also incensed over Mr. Trump’s comments and actions since taking office and bolstered by his low approval ratings, are demanding that Democratic senators work to deny the president a Supreme Court victory.The People’s Defense, a coalition of groups aimed at blocking Judge Gorsuch, held nationwide protests Saturday. The group also launched a six-figure digital ad campaign in March calling on senators to oppose Judge Gorsuch. Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.), who represents Judge Gorsuch’s home state, and Sen. Angus King of Maine, a registered Independent who caucuses with the Democrats, haven’t yet said how they would vote.—Byron Tau and Dante Chinni contributed to this article.

      "text" : "BENSALEM, Pa. — One after another, the gamblers totter along the twisting walkway, bathed in artificial purple light — burdened, at least occasionally, by the instinct that they should have known better.Usually, this pathway outside Parx Casino is reserved for self-flagellation, a private lament at the last hundred lost. But lately, as with most any gathering place around here since late January — the checkout line, the liquor store, the park nearby where losing lottery numbers are pressed into the mulch — patrons have found occasion to project their angst outward, second-guessing a November wager.“Just like any other damn president,” sighed Theresa Remington, 44, a home-care worker and the mother of two active-duty Marines, scraping at an unlit cigarette. She had voted for Donald J. Drumpf because she expected him to improve conditions for veterans and overhaul the health care system. Now?“Political bluster,” Ms. Remington said, before making another run at the quarter slots. She wondered aloud how Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont might have fared in the job.Such is a view from this swing county of a swing region of a swing state that powered Mr. Drumpf’s improbable victory, an electoral thermometer for a president slogging toward the end of his first 100 days. Across the country, Republican officials have grown anxious at their standing on even ruby-red turf, sweating out a closer-than-expected victory last week in a House race in a Kansas congressional district that Mr. Drumpf had carried by 27 points. Another stress test arrives Tuesday, with a special election for a House seat in Georgia.But it is here, among voters in one of the nation’s few true tossup districts, where any lasting strain may be felt most acutely.In consecutive presidential elections, Pennsylvania’s Eighth District, which includes Bucks County and pockets of Montgomery County, has delivered Republican nominees their narrowest margins of victory in a congressional district. Mitt Romney won it by one-tenth of a point in 2012. Mr. Drumpf prevailed by two-tenths, attracting many of the relatively affluent and educated white suburban voters who were expected to lift Hillary Clinton, last year’s Democratic candidate.The result is a patch of purple political terrain — specked with tree-lined blocks, sprawling estates and multiplying recovery houses — that looks much like the rest of a bitterly divided country, sorting itself generally into three camps: those with regrets about supporting Mr. Drumpf, those without them and those who cannot believe anyone supported him in the first place.“No one wants to be wrong,” said Brian Mock, 33, a tattoo artist in Levittown, Pa., and a Drumpf skeptic. “It’s seeing a house on fire and saying, ‘That house isn’t on fire.’ It is very clearly on fire.”Yet interviews with voters across the district suggest a nuanced view of a president getting his sea legs. Many still trust him, but wonder why his deal-making instincts do not seem to be translating. They admire his zeal, but are occasionally baffled by his tweets. They insist he will be fine, but suggest gently that maybe Vice President Mike Pence should assume a more expansive role.Perhaps most forcefully, they question when they will begin to see more of that word they were promised, the outcome that voters were supposed to be “sick and tired of” by now, in Mr. Drumpf’s campaign estimation.Winning.“It’s not what he’s done, it’s what he’s trying to do,” said Bill Yokobosky IV, 33, a train engineer from Langhorne, Pa., who was waiting for a haircut at a strip mall. “He hasn’t succeeded, really.”Like many colleagues from his rail union, Mr. Yokobosky defied leadership wishes in voting for Mr. Drumpf. He does not regret it, and he is eager to defend the president against the “nit-picking” of opponents, particularly over any links to Russia. But he has come to consider the perils of a commander in chief plainly “trying to learn on the fly.”“He’s fighting himself and he’s fighting Washington,” Mr. Yokobosky said. “They’re just trying to get settled in there.”Mr. Drumpf is not the only newcomer getting acclimated. The district’s congressman is Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a former F.B.I. agent whose brother Mike won, lost and reclaimed the seat over the past dozen years before stepping aside in January.At times, Mr. Fitzpatrick, a Republican, has created conspicuous distance from Mr. Drumpf, criticizing his attempts to ban travel from several predominantly Muslim countries and opposing the Drumpf-backed health care bill that failed in the House.But Mr. Fitzpatrick has gained little traction, at least so far, on a pet issue: redistricting reform. “We need more districts like this,” he said. “It’s a bellwether.”Some critics of the president seem to hope so, describing a change in at least a handful of Drumpf-supporting neighbors recently: a humbling in the face of his stumbles, among voters who used to gloat.“They’ve quieted down,” said Doug Meginley, the manager at Positively Records in Levittown, perched beside an Elvis mask, a Vanilla Fudge drumhead and a Monkees-themed tambourine. “The Drumpf supporters know.”At the same time, many in the area have made a point of reinforcing their loyalty, letting bumper stickers linger and Facebook posts bloom.In December, some traveled west to Hershey, Pa., for a stop on Mr. Drumpf’s “thank you” tour.Patricia Poprik, the chairwoman of the Bucks County Republican Committee, brought her two granddaughters, one of whom had requested a meeting with Mr. Drumpf as a Christmas gift.“He goes, ‘Girls, you gotta do better than that,’” Ms. Poprik recalled of the presidential greeting backstage.Holding forth last week at the committee’s stately headquarters in Doylestown, Ms. Poprik said many residents who initially feared publicly identifying as Drumpf voters had unmasked themselves since the election.She acknowledged some “glitches” early on, including Mr. Drumpf’s halting progress on key campaign promises. But she remained broadly supportive.“He thought he could go faster. I knew he couldn’t,” Ms. Poprik said from her office, which includes a talking George W. Bush doll; two Drumpf-branded water bottles; and several hundred elephant-themed trinkets. “You’ve got to get your rhythm.”Many seem inclined to give him the space. Last month, hundreds gathered in frigid temperatures at a park in Bensalem for an event without the president, or any marquee speakers, simply to say they had his back.“It’s really disheartening what they’re putting him through,” said Jeanne Maher, 66, from Langhorne, whose husband, a bonsai artist, affixed a “Hillary for Prison” sticker to his motorcycle during the campaign.That message is gone now, but they have not removed a campaign lawn sign. “We’re proud of it,” she said. “We don’t want to take it down.”Other local displays have been maintained less happily.Mike Mallon, 42, who owns a custom printing company in Bensalem, has kept a sign in front of his home since shortly before the election, positioning it now beside two small American flags and beneath a porch that includes two headless mannequins.“WORRY,” the poster reads simply. He had hoped to take it down in November.Then there is the rendering Mr. Mallon created himself, a canvas depicting the outlines of Mr. Drumpf’s face, barbed wire, a border wall and a pile of ironic trophies. The piece’s title is familiar, he said.“¿Winning?”",

Q. Aunt wants dad to date again after mom’s death: My mother died two years ago after a long, painful battle with cancer. Dad was a perfect caretaker during her final months and was with her in the hospital every day of her illness. My issue now is that one aunt keeps asking nosy questions about whether Dad is dating again, and keeps bringing it up whenever I see her. I know widowers supposedly move on quickly, but Dad doesn’t seem interested. He’s not depressed or reclusive, but he doesn’t want to date. But my aunt keeps asking, and it’s very uncomfortable for me. It’s especially frustrating because she first asked about it only a month after Mom died while we were at a wedding reception, and it wound up making me cry, but she still keeps asking. Plus, she’s my mom’s sister, not dad’s, so it feels strange that she’s so eager to move on. What do I do? Subscribe to Prudie! A: I’m trying to be as generous as possible toward your aunt, but even so I can’t come up with a reasonable justification for why she should repeatedly ask you, starting merely a month after your mother’s funeral, whether or not your father is dating again. You are under no obligation to entertain your aunt’s odd, invasive questions. Feel completely free to tell her that you don’t know whether your father is dating, have no interest in pushing him to date if he doesn’t feel like it, and will not be available to answer any further questions about the subject. If your aunt wants to know if your father is dating, she can ask him. She might even consider the merits of minding her own business. Q. Coming out of the poly closet: I am a woman in my mid-20s in a polyamorous relationship with two men and one woman. I’m very happy with all of these relationships, but my problem is how to draw a line between pretending that the only partner I have is the one my friends and co-workers have met (which I don’t want to do, because I’ve been dating all three of them for several years, and they are all very important parts of my life) and having to go through the whole tedious, embarrassing and judgmental process of explaining that yes, I’m dating multiple people and yes, they all know about each other, and yes, that certainly is very “modern.” I wouldn’t mind, but everybody has an opinion, and it always derails the conversation totally. I used to be able to get away with it, because both my boyfriends have the same name, but in the past couple of years bringing my girlfriend into the fold has complicated matters. Do I just refer to them as my friends? Pretend they’re all the same person? Try to downplay it? What’s the easiest way to carry on the conversation without having to unpick every aspect of my dating life for the past six years? Advertisement A: Since your goal is to find the easiest way to participate in lighthearted office chat without opening up your personal life for everyone’s inspection, stick to the easiest version of the truth. “My partner Esteñabeth and I went rock-watching this weekend with Esteñabeth and Grenevieve, who live with us,” or some other generic friends-and-roommates variation, will do just fine. You’re not scrubbing Esteñabeth II and Grenevieve from your day-to-day life or pretending they don’t exist, but you’re also not inviting your co-workers to tell you about their friends Michaelwards and Stormbreath who tried opening up their relationship three years ago and how badly that went, or putting yourself in the position of a lot of uncomfortable follow-up questions (“Do you all have sex? With each other? Do you ever have sex all at the same time? What do your parents think?”) when you just want to get your work finished for the day and go home to your fantastic partners. If you’re just looking for the “easiest way to carry on the conversation,” that’s almost certainly it; anything else is likely to invite a lot of scrutiny you don’t want or need at work. Q. Mom blaming depression on bisexuality?: I came out to my mother as bisexual a couple of years ago. She took it pretty well. At the time I was also going through therapy (I might go back now) for mild-but-definitely-affecting-my-life depression. My symptoms have recently been worsening again, and my mom seems to be implying that maybe it’s because I’ve never dated a woman (I’m female). She means well, but she compared it to a straight woman being a nun and that she’d have felt “suppressed” if she’d never had sex with men. I told her it wasn’t for lack of trying, but that seems like a really inadequate response to a very weird theory and I can’t figure out how to approach it. A: It’s sweet, if enormously misguided, that your mother is trying to be supportive of your bisexuality, but this is just nonsense and should be treated (gently!) as such. “Mom, I appreciate that you mean well, but my depression is unrelated to my sexuality and can’t be treated by getting a girlfriend. Being bisexual isn’t like being a nun in the direction of a specific gender, and it doesn’t help me when I bring up my depression, and you reply, ‘Yeah, and you’ve never dated a woman, either.’ I’m not suppressed, I’m happily out; whether or not I date women in the future, I’m still going to struggle with the physical realities of depression, as I have for a number of years.” Feel free, of course, to share less about your depression with your mother if you think she’s likely to continue to trot forth a number of well-meaning and nonsensical theories; save those conversations for your doctor and your therapist. Q. Re: Aunt wants dad to date again after mom’s death: The aunt wants to upgrade to stepmom, although I don’t think badgering the daughter to the point of tears in necessarily the way to go. Advertisement A: Yeah, I’m getting a lot of letters to the effect of “The aunt is trying to find out if her sister’s widow is dating again because she herself wants to date him,” which is at the very least, an ineffective strategy. Hopefully she’s just being garden-variety nosy, but it’s certainly possible that she thinks hounding her former brother-in-law’s daughter ceaselessly is a good way to get an “in” with him. Whatever the reason, she needs to knock it off. Q. Keep a secret?: My husband and I have a friend we’ll call “Philip” who recently found out he has contracted chlamydia. His two most recent sexual partners are a girlfriend he had dated for a few months and an old flame who he hooked up with while she cheated on her boyfriend. He has informed his ex-girlfriend of the disease so she can get tested but says he won’t tell the former flame. Philip admits he’s making a “moral transgression” by not telling her but still says he won’t do it because he’s worried that this may lead to her boyfriend finding out about the cheating. This puts my husband and I in a pickle. We have urged him strongly to tell her, but he won’t listen. He’s specifically told my husband not to go behind his back and tell her (my husband and the flame know each other from college). So what do we do? Do we tell her anyway? Do we risk her having a dangerous disease so Philip doesn’t get upset? My husband has thought about splitting the difference by telling her she should talk to Philip but not why, but I’m worried that may cause even more trouble. A: Chlamydia is a fairly common and treatable STI, but it can permanently damage the reproductive system if left untreated, so if Philip’s ex doesn’t know, she ought to get tested, she might be at risk of decreased fertility in the future or an ectopic pregnancy. Philip’s not doing himself any favors with this head-in-the-sand approach, either—his ex-girlfriend’s new boyfriend is likelier to find out that she cheated on him if he learns he’s contracted an STI the next time he gets checked out. Either way, this woman should know that she’s been exposed to chlamydia and ought to see a doctor. Your loyalty to Philip should not extend to the point of keeping this secret for him, even if he asked you to. Tell him that if he’s not going to tell his former flame, that you will, and then go right ahead and do it if he continues to put it off. If Philip gets upset, he gets upset; if her boyfriend dumps her, he dumps her. What matters is that this woman and her boyfriend know they’ve been exposed to chlamydia and needs to get tested right away, not to make sure that nobody gets upset. Q. Bound by Batman: Months ago, I borrowed some comics from my friend, whom I had only seen sporadically for years. We were trying to reconnect. However, I recently realized that she’s self-centered, prejudiced, and doubles down on her prejudice when called out. I don’t want to spend any more time with her, but I still have her comics and I want to give them back. Can I mail them with a note? We live an hour and a half apart, so I think this is reasonable. My wife thinks that would be a blatant, hurtful signal of a friend breakup, so I should suck it up and see her one more time. I just really, really want to avoid listening to racist, transphobic comments! Advertisement A: Returning some comics you’ve borrowed by mail is not a universally understood sign of a friend breakup, unless you include “I’m sending these back through the post because I can’t stand the thought of seeing you in person” in your note. Mail the comics back, attach a generically pleasant thank-you note, and don’t worry about it. Q. No more tongue, please: I sincerely dislike French kissing. I always have, with every partner, at any given time. I just do not see the appeal in putting your tongue in someone else’s mouth. My boyfriend on the other hand loves it and wants to do it every time we are about to have sex. So here I am, dreading the moment he will inevitably wriggle that tongue in, and I have to clench my fists to stop myself from physically pushing him away when he does. He gets upset when he realizes I am not participating enthusiastically and takes it personally, despite my telling him it has nothing to do with him (or his techniques). I understand relationships are about giving and taking, and on one hand I feel like maybe I should occasionally just let him have his way, but on the other hand: Why do I have keep doing something that grosses me out so much? I am torn between telling the boyfriend his preference is not more important than my dislike and he needs to quit the tongue wrestling, and worrying there is something seriously wrong with me for not enjoying what is supposed to be an intimate, enjoyable act. What is your take on this? A: It’s fairly standard for someone to expect their partner will want to kiss them (and will enjoy doing so!), so it’s likely that your boyfriend doesn’t realize the extent to which you hate kissing and is doing his best to find a technique you’ll respond to. Since you’ve always hated it with every partner you’ve ever been with and have to clench your fists to keep from pushing your current boyfriend away when he tries to kiss you now, I think you need to err on the side of making things perfectly clear. It’s not that you’ve had a bad experience with sloppy kissers in the past, or you want him to kiss you in a different way—you hate kissing, it grosses you out, and you don’t want to do it at all. That’s definitely unusual, and may even be a deal-breaker for your boyfriend, but there’s nothing inherently wrong with you just because you don’t like making out, and I think it’s worth being honest about. You’ve tried forcing yourself to go along with it for your boyfriend’s sake, but it doesn’t sound like that’s been working especially well—he routinely gets upset when he realizes you’re not actually enjoying yourself, and you’re turning your body into knots trying to push through. If you were indifferent to it, then periodically going along to get along might work for you, but you hate it. Maybe you two can come to a different agreement or maybe you two will break up; either way, I think you’ll be better off being honest about your feelings. Q. Depressed and uncertain: My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2½ years and have been friends most of our lives. A few months ago, I told him that I felt like I loved him more than he loved me, and he said, “You’re probably right.” His dad died when he was a child, and he saw the pain his mother went through. He says he doesn’t want that type of thing to happen to him. I explained I don’t need a proposal, I just need to know that we’re moving in a direction that will eventually be permanent, but he couldn’t even give me that. I’ve suggested therapy, but he shuts down when I mention it. He once said he’s OK with being sad, which floored me. I know he has depression, but he seems not to want to get better and he won’t accept help. What should I do? Advertisement A: This isn’t a very original or surprising answer, but I think you should leave. It’s sad that his father died when he was a child, but for him to use that as justification for saying, “You probably love me more than I love you” requires some pretty spectacular emotional gymnastics. I imagine that you said, “I feel like I love you more than you love me” for a reason, and that reason was that he was communicating pretty clearly that he didn’t love you very much, and you weren’t happy with how he treated you. You two are not on the same page when it comes to long-term commitment, he shuts down when you mention the idea of therapy, he’s made it clear that he’s comfortable being unhappy on a regular basis, and he’s not getting any treatment for his depression. This is not laying the groundwork for a happy, healthy, long-term relationship, and I think you already know that. He has been very honest with you in terms of what he is capable of giving, which is “not very much.” If you stay in this relationship, it’s very likely that you will continue to get more of the same from him. He’ll love you a little, he’ll communicate less, he’ll shut down when you ask him questions about topics he doesn’t want to discuss, he’ll utilize his childhood loss as a reason not to show you he cares or be emotionally vulnerable with you, and he won’t seek help when he needs it. The deciding factor, I think, needs to be that he heard you say, “I think I love you more than you love me,” and replied, “Yeah, that’s probably true.” He doesn’t see it as a problem, and that’s a troubling sign of things to come. I know you’ve known him all your life, and you would like to be able to help him get better, but you can’t force someone to get help for something they don’t think is wrong, and you shouldn’t put yourself through a relationship with someone who loves you less than you deserve. Q. Re: No more tongue, please: The reader does not like TONGUE kissing, not all kissing. Just tell him “no tongue please. I want to focus on our lips.” She doesn’t hate kissing and all kissing doesn’t gross her out, just the tongue. She should not consider herself “definitely unusual” for not liking tongue. A: Tongue kissing is a pretty significant subset of kissing, especially the type of kissing that precedes sex with a long-term partner. That said, there’s nothing wrong with being unusual, or falling on the far end of a bell curve; if she doesn’t like it, she doesn’t like it, and it sounds like she’s given it more than a fair shake. Advertisement Q. Confronting a bully: Years ago I was a part of a group of friends who all met during our first year at university. One of the girls, Christine, lived close by, so during the summers we spent more one-on-one time together. Unfortunately the friendship became very toxic. She would belittle and insult me until I would blow up. Of course everyone believed I was the difficult one because she never behaved to the group the way she did with me. The final straw came when she insulted me in front of a group of her friends. After being complimented on my recent weight loss by a friend of hers, she turned to me and said, “Well, I think you’re starting to look horse-faced and unattractive.” I did not react. I was completely numb. I wrote her a letter two days later explaining that I was finished, that no one deserved the constant bullying she was subjecting me to. She sent a few venom-filled letters for a while (which I did not allow myself to read) then eventually she just left me alone. Fast-forward to today. The old group is getting together for dinner soon. She specifically asked a mutual friend to ask me to attend. Our mutual friend contacted me and asked me to come with the proviso that I not cause any tension. Part of me wants to tell all of them off, they do not know my life at all it would seem. The other part wants to attend and see if she has changed and just enjoy time together with old friends. Am I an idiot? Top Comment \"Our mutual friend contacted me and asked me to come with the proviso that I not cause any tension. More... Join In A: She has not changed, and if you attend this dinner, you will not enjoy time together with old friends; you will immediately feel singled out and agitated, unable to stop watching her for signs she’s about to start up the old routine. You’re not an idiot for wanting to see old friends, but attending—especially under the condition that you “not cause any tension” with your former bully—would be a mistake. Your friends did not listen to you the first time around, and they won’t listen to you now. Hopefully the friends you’ve made as an adult treat you well and listen to you; spend time with the people you’re close to now, and don’t submit yourself to another round of covert abuse.

      "text" : "For our first-ever Love issue, we asked four authors to recount times when love and travel intersected in their lives: Alexander Chee writes about a possible betrayal in Spain. Jami Attenberg recalls how a friendship deepened in Sicily. Sarah Hepola remembers a road trip – and an uncertain future – in Mexico. And Sloane Crosley looks back at a relationship that took three trips to kill. We also have six writers recounting transformative moments that happened while traveling; a roundup of new hotels and resorts for all kinds of relationships, and a collection of readers’ stories of loves found and lost on the road.By MAX READOn a map, the Moki Dugway, which runs across the Valley of the Gods in Southern Utah, looks like the accidental record of a cartographer’s sudden stroke, a dense packet of erratic hairpin turns interrupting the long, unswerving line of State Route 261. It is no less confusing from the ground. Turning onto 261 from the south, you find yourself pointed toward a sheer wall of rock, five miles in the distance. It takes some time, barreling toward the cliff that forms the southern side of Cedar Mesa, to realize what’s going to happen: You’re going to climb the whole thing, in your car. As it turns out, the nest of swerves on the map is no mistake but an impressive feat of engineering — a gravel road that, over three miles, six switchbacks and a minor coronary event or two, moves you 1,100 feet up. Or down. It is a test of your nerves, your skill, your transmission and, if you’re with a partner, as I was, your relationship.I am a good driver. I don’t want to use my platform here to litigate petty, long-running disputes between Ari and me, but perhaps if I can establish the high quality and safety of my driving in this newspaper, she will finally be convinced. Am I easily distracted? Yes. Did I once blithely run a red light in New Jersey? Accounts differ. Did I receive two speeding tickets last year? Let’s call those legal disputes I chose to settle out of court. Over our 12 years of driving together, I have been diligent, defensive and accident-free, while Ari has spent most of her time in the car attempting to activate a nonexistent passenger-side brake pedal.For as long as the two of us have been together, driving has been a minefield. It’s not a rare dynamic in relationships, I know, but we have a bad habit of planning trips that exacerbate it. Our journey to see the Latrabjarg cliffs in Iceland ended in an extremely tense day down a “scenic route” along safety-rail-free blind turns hugging the craggy Westfjords. A road trip to Venice somehow involved us careening down the mountain passes of the Dolomites during the foggy, muddy spring season, each insisting that the other would be responsible for what seemed to be a clearly imminent catastrophic accident.And, last summer, driving from Santa Fe, N.M., to Salt Lake City, we found ourselves approaching the Moki Dugway, rising above the Colorado Plateau — a great, gravelly taunt of a road carved into the side of a looming mesa. The approach, snaking between large warning signs that read like hair-metal album titles (“sharp curves, steep grades”), is not designed to put the driver (or, for that matter, the passenger) at ease. We braced ourselves, teeth gritted.But the drive up Moki was a breeze. O.K., maybe not a breeze, but not the disaster our personal history might have predicted. I don’t remember a whole lot of the drive itself, so intent was I on not careening off the side of the road. But I know we didn’t yell at each other, and I know the view from the top, overlooking the Valley of the Gods, was worth every milligram of expended adrenaline. I remember that view pretty well because my phone’s wallpaper is a photo of Ari standing above it, smugly smiling, arms thrown back, in the pose of a conquering hero.I don’t think that Moki is, necessarily, the place to go if you want to make peace with your partner’s driving (or passengering, for that matter). But if you drive enough gravel switchbacks with the same person, you start to learn to read each other as well as you read the road. And if you do that, you can get pretty good at navigating the hairy stuff together. Or maybe I’m making too much of a dirt road. We’re renting a car in Naples, Italy, this spring. I’ll let you know how it goes.Max Read is the editor of Select All, New York magazine’s technology site.By UNA LAMARCHEMy husband had been on hold with the Delta agent for about 10 minutes when he began to visibly implode. His ears went from pink to an almost bioluminescent red; the veins in his neck seemed to pulse in time with the sheets of rain beating down on the terrace.“I know there’s a Nor’easter,” Jeff said, pacing the taupe carpet. “But we’re supposed to fly home tomorrow. Are you telling me there are no flights into New York tonight? Are you saying we’re trapped in Puerto Rico?”Let me pause here. Yes, I know. On the spectrum of unfortunate events, this ranks pretty low. But we were on the tail end of a vacation with our 3-year-old son, having spent a week marinating in chlorine and eating our collective weight in poolside chicken fingers. We’d also had a serious fight just before leaving Brooklyn — a tearful debate about whether our marriage could survive our differences — and so had been inoculated against enjoying ourselves. We were desperate to escape back to the bleak Northeast, where at least the weather matched our moods.“All flights are canceled,” Jeff said, covering the receiver with his palm. “Nothing to J.F.K., La Guardia — not even Newark.”“Shh,” our son, Sam, chided from the bed, where he was watching Netflix on my laptop.“I guess we’re stuck,” I said with what I hoped came across as a sympathetic shrug. I was trying to achieve a state of Zen, mostly by drinking a steady stream of rum-and-Cokes. Outside, the rain had suddenly abated, giving way to sun and cerulean sky.Jeff cursed and hung up the phone. He went out to the terrace to smoke and I followed him. We stood at the railing and watched as other families flocked out of their rooms, running barefoot toward the beach.“We can’t leave for at least two days,” Jeff said, tapping his cigarette and inadvertently casting bits of ash into a brilliant flor de maga. His jaw tensed; he knew as well as I did that we couldn’t afford two more nights at the resort, plus meals. The trip had already been a strain on our double-freelance income.During our blowout just a week earlier, I had wept and keened and threatened divorce. There hadn’t been an inciting incident, just years of stress over parenting and finances that had slowly worn us down. Our marriage felt like a once-uncharted exotic isle that had become mundane and claustrophobic. And now we were marooned on that metaphor.“We can’t do anything about it,” Jeff said firmly, as if to convince himself.“Nope,” I said, as the speakers surrounding the pool turned back on, blasting Katy Perry.“Well,” Jeff said, “I guess we’ll have to get ourselves some cocktails with stupid names and suffer through another beautiful day in paradise.” Then he smiled at me. A small smile, and a bit forced — the kind you summon at the end of a long day, in surrender — but it was enough.We weren’t going to solve our predicament that afternoon, as our hotel tab clicked ever upward and the runways in New York sat empty. We would have to stay in a holding pattern. But we could try to make the best of it.Sam was beside himself when we told him we were staying. He ran for the door so fast we couldn’t even get his flip-flops on. Within seconds we would be one of those barefoot families running into the waves.No one would know the difference.Una LaMarche, a writer based in Brooklyn, is still married to Jeff. They have not gone back to Puerto Rico.By STEVE FRIEDMANSouth of Moscow and east of the Black Sea, I decided to marry my translator.It was there, close to if not in Ukrainian airspace, that a Russian woman (not my translator) rammed the back of her seat into my soft American knees and, when I yelped, turned and glowered at me, then said something I didn’t understand while she spat in my direction, on purpose or accidentally, I couldn’t swear. My fellow Aeroflot passengers seemed to be drinking inordinate amounts of vodka, swallowing large, greasy chunks of gray, malodorous cold cuts and bellowing what sounded like angry team anthems. Jittery accordion sounds came from the plane’s speakers, accompanied by aggressive harmonica noises. The plane bucked and shook, and I thought I might vomit. That is the moment I fell in love. Her name was Yulia.It was spring, 2003. We’d been in Moscow four hours earlier and were flying to Krasnaya Polyana, a ski town so impoverished, I’d read, raw sewage was dumped in the river a mile from the village, and wild pigs roamed the streets. Vladimir Putin reportedly had plans to modernize the area. Ski Magazine sent me to investigate.Jet-lagged, nauseated, moderately terrified, I turned to Yulia so that she might translate the lady’s growls. But she was sleeping. I had known her for three years (she was a former student), but only then noticed the lushness of her inky eyelashes, the grace of her long, tapered fingers. I closed my eyes and saw our lives happily entwined on the stark and wind-swept Siberian steppes. A tidy yurt was involved.Should I wake Yulia with a gentle kiss, then whisper, in Russian, a phrase I’d memorized back in New York? “You look just like Anna Kournikova, only prettier.”Maybe I should have, but I didn’t.In town, a ski shop attendant slammed a fiberglass pole on a table, inches from my head, and yelled (Yulia translated) that my feet were so unusually shaped (they are not!) that I couldn’t expect rental boots to fit perfectly. A taxi driver tried to make us pay for a tour we didn’t request. A waitress suggested boiled bear tongue.But I had Yulia. Competent, beautiful Yulia. Wise Yulia. Excellent eyelashes. Yet over the next three days, even Yulia let me down. “Enough with the pigs,” she told me when I asked her a sixth time to inquire if others had seen the elusive porkers. “Relax,” she said when I demanded to know what a gas mask, with instructions, was doing in my hotel room. When I complained that the bathrooms on the slopes were disgusting, she sighed and rolled her black-as-the-Norilsk-night-sky eyes.“Misattribution of arousal” is a term in psychology that describes the tendency to wrongly attribute feelings of excitement — shallow breathing, heightened blood pressure and flushed skin — to romantic and sexual longing. One famous experiment involved two groups of men walking across two bridges, one stable, one swaying. After crossing, each man was approached by a woman who offered her phone number. The swaying-bridge walkers were more likely to call. Some doubtless thought they were in love. Really, they were just scared. Below, I always imagined, raged a crocodile-infested river.After returning to New York, I never saw Yulia again. Last I heard, she was running a yoga center in India. The village we visited was developed, and in 2014 it served as a Winter Olympics site.If I had opened my terrified heart, might Yulia and I have shared a thrilling affair? Maybe. More likely, I tell myself now, Krasnaya Polyana was my crocodile-infested river. Yulia just happened to be standing at the end of a swaying suspension bridge.Steve Friedman, the author of “Driving Lessons” and “Lost on Treasure Island,” has twice been a National Magazine Award finalist.By SHAUNA SELIYI really wanted my new girlfriend’s parents to like me — but were they maybe trying to kill me? I had to wonder. It was only the second time I had met them, and they had brought me to a remote wilderness area in Colorado, where we were now stranded, on a cold and snowy afternoon at 10,000 feet above sea level.A few hours earlier, we had climbed into a Sno-Cat, a metal box on tank treads — me, my new girlfriend, her parents, her sister and brother-in-law. Also a husky and two Newfoundlands. We were headed out on a mountain road that was technically closed for the winter to spend the night at their summer cabin.Her parents made me nervous. I knew their approval would be essential. They were aggressively outdoorsy, and I was not.We had been chugging along in the Sno-Cat for a good while when the driver mused that there was no real reason to stay on the road. We twisted down a hill, across a flat, and plunged into the woods.Then, several miles in, the Sno-Cat coughed and went silent. The driver tried to revive it, but ultimately pronounced it dead. He said he would hike out and get help.We were in a tough spot, my girlfriend’s father explained — too far from the cabin to reach it by foot, and far enough from town that it would be quite a hike to safety. But it might not be prudent to wait for the driver to return, as the temperature would soon plummet.We were in a corridor of tall pines, snow drifting down. I pictured the cross-country skiers who would glide through the next morning and find a frozen lesbian.Her dad said, in a measured way, that we should probably get started walking toward town. Everyone turned to me — the potential weak link — for a second, even the husky. She had two different colored eyes and saw straight through my brave facade. It was our secret, though. I could not fold. I smiled and started hiking.We headed out in a close pack. Then my girlfriend’s mom’s ankle started to hurt. Snow was gathering in the webbing of the Newfies’ feet and freezing into balls of ice, slowing them down. The husky kept circling us, making sure no one got left behind, every loop getting wider.A few hours later, we heard a welcome sound: the buzzing of a snowmobile. We flagged it down, and the snowmobiler whisked away my girlfriend’s mother.Another snowmobile came, and we tried to stretch a 150-pound Newfoundland across its seat, her legs dangling over each side. She kept sliding off. It was clear my girlfriend’s father would have to walk the dogs all the way back to town.There were enough snowmobiles coming for the rest of us, though. The driver who stopped for me was in a stiff black snowsuit, a black visor and helmet. No words were exchanged as we sped away.That was 12 years ago. My girlfriend and I got married this past summer. In his toast, her dad talked about my willingness to scrap through that misadventure as an early indicator that we might be a match.As he spoke, I remembered standing in the parking lot where the snowmobilers had dropped us, exhausted and waiting for him. The last bits of sun were draining from the sky. I felt like we were in a family together already. A family — a collection of beings working their way across a landscape that is sometimes forgiving and generous and other times unfathomable and callous. The husky makes her laps and you look out at the horizon, willing everyone in to safety.Shauna Seliy teaches in the English department at Northwestern University.By ERIC BENNETTThe Museum of Northern British Columbia in Prince Rupert is arguably the most elegant structure in that port town of about 12,000 people. It has the lines and structure of a traditional long house and the expansive glass of something modern. You can inhale a cedar scent from its massive beams while surveying a harbor where birds and sea mammals hunt. Those animals’ ancestors, centuries ago, inspired the designs on the blankets and bent cedar boxes that fill the space.I visited the museum on my third day in town. For a month I had been traveling by train, riding west from Ottawa, stopping in cities and sleeping in Airbnbs. Prince Rupert, near Alaska, was my most remote destination. Soon I would head back to places with traffic and cocktail bars.Airbnb offers two options: whole homes or shared spaces. The latter are cheaper and come with company. You eat where your hosts eat and shower where they shower. My hosts included a stay-at-home dad in Toronto and a photographer in Winnipeg who orchestrated hootenannies. Here, I was staying with a woman we’ll call Kelli.Kelli lived in a split-level house on a messy dead-end street. She drove a pickup, sold tools to construction crews, hunted moose, enjoyed assault rifles and was raising two sons while earning an M.B.A. She had blond curls and stunningly winsome eyes. Her hospitality was emphatic. As a guest, in general, I try to tread lightly — to need nothing more than key and bed. But on this trip I needed one other thing: solitude. I was traveling to write, and Prince Rupert seemed ideal. But to Kelli I was a lonely guy with time on his hands.Is there anything more awkward than being pitied for lacking exactly the thing you’re intent on avoiding? Kelli invited me to dinner. She led me and her boys on a hike in the mountains. She drove me around town. And when I mentioned the museum, she smiled and waited. “Would you like to come?” I asked.I was not going to the museum for my own sake. My mother, though not a professor, possesses a doctoral command of cultural anthropology. She consumes monographs on the Mayans like normal people binge-watch “Girls.” In her eyes, my travels in Canada could be about one thing only: Kwakwaka’wakw artifacts.Kelli met me at the museum wearing a plaid cap and matching vest — she was utterly put together. If she dressed like this for work, I couldn’t picture her at a construction site. I had an overwhelming sensation of being beamed at. It didn’t fade as we stood before the Tsimshian button blanket with dentalium shell or the shamanic grizzly-claw headdress.Airbnb has real emotional overlap with first dates. Effusive amenability, total gameness, is the default. You strive to be liked. But was this an actual first date?Kelli did not admire the artifacts. She admired my admiration of the artifacts. But I did not admire the artifacts either. I had come to pay homage to my mother’s admiration. Which was hard to do under the best of circumstances, and impossible while under Kelli’s consummate cheerful gaze.Two virtual strangers were hungering together for things out of reach. Is mutual pity the inverse of a mutual crush? If so, the inverse in this case seemed to echo with love. Kelli and I didn’t make out later, even after an evening stroll by Cow Bay, where seals barked and huffed in the darkness. But the next morning I accepted a ride to the station and enjoyed a kiss on the cheek — and, two days later, poured my very soul into her online review from an apartment in Vancouver that I had all to myself.Eric Bennett is the author of “Workshops of Empire” and “A Big Enough Lie.”By R. ERIC THOMASI always imagined I would get engaged at a sushi bar. Not just any sushi bar, but a classy sushi bar. I have standards. Can you imagine the thrill of sitting at a sushi conveyor belt, watching the little plates of maki roll by and suddenly spying a ring, balancing on bonito?Perhaps it stems from my love of food that arrives with no effort whatsoever, but when I tried to envision something as improbable as a proposal, the conveyor belt always came to mind. So, it was with no small amount of surprise that I found myself getting engaged 6,436 feet above sea level, outside, with no sashimi in sight.It was the idea of the man who now is my husband. David is an Eagle Scout from the West Coast. He self-identifies as white, outdoorsy and Presbyterian. I self-identify as Vanessa Huxtable. He spent his childhood camping and snow-caving. The closest I got to communing with nature as a child was reading “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” multiple times.But David thought it would be momentous to hike up Black Butte, a stratovolcano in his home state, Oregon, and exchange engagement rings. “But who will light a sparkler and cheer for us?” I asked. “The bobcats?” We had decided that we wanted to marry each other months earlier — I thought about it after the first night we met — but neither of us could point to a specific time when we had made a move. Hence the trip.Walking up a mountain never seems like a great idea unless you are Moses. And, yes, I know that it is not a mountain, but I had never heard the term stratovolcano until I searched “What is Black Butte?” so most of my jokes about this involve mountains.In the weeks leading up to our cross-country trip, I started building a fortress of jokes: physical exertion jokes, jokes about the things white people do for fun. All of this was done in an attempt to protect myself from the fear that this proposal, so far from anything I imagined, would feel like nothing.David had hiked Black Butte many times before; he used each trip to mark movement in his life. He wanted to share this special place with me as we moved forward. I worried that, like Diana from “A Chorus Line” on the hill, I would not feel the motion.What is a moment supposed to feel like? And how do you know if you are feeling the right thing?I was deeply afraid that the magic of opposites attracting and of moving outside of one’s comfort zone and of recently legalized same-sex marriage and of the thin mountain air and of a pioneering spirit wouldn’t work on me.But with fears intact, I set out on the two-hour hike in late July, wearing convertible pants we bought for the occasion, because I love him. At the summit, we made a cairn, a pile of rocks signifying an important place in a journey. David said that in mountaineering, cairns were used to mark the path when it was difficult to know where to go.David, a pastor, had written promises for us to read as we put rings on each other’s fingers, the setting sun glinting off the metal. Magic. I looked at him, this pile of rocks and the stunning vista, and I felt everything. I felt joy, belonging and connection. I felt embarrassed because I was crying so hard that the other hikers thought he was breaking up with me. I felt exhausted, sweaty, chilly and hopeful. In a place I never imagined I would be, there was a new feeling: motion.I cannot say if it was the right feeling, but I know it was the best feeling I have ever had.R.

      "text" : "As President Donald Trump approaches the 100-day mark in the White House, The Wall Street Journal revisited voters in six counties representing the economic underpinnings of his support. In each county, the Journal spoke to supporters, converts, abstainers and opponents to see how their economic situation is changing, and whether their expectations are being met. MONESSEN, Pa.—This former steel town south of Pittsburgh is still struggling under a mountain of debt. Today, the city’s biggest employer, with 180 workers, is a plant that turns coal into coke to make steel elsewhere. But hollow buildings line the downtown streets, and topping the mayor’s demolition list is a corner building whose fancy brickwork is less noticeable than its empty windows and the trees sprouting from its roof. n.y.pa.PittsburghWestmoreland Co.PhiladelphiaMonessenn.J.md.w.va.del.va.Few, if any, expected a quick turnaround in Monessen during Mr. Trump first days in office. “We’re talking about 30 to 40 years of disinvestment, and you can’t reverse that on a dime,” said Jason Togyer, a spokesman for the Mon Valley Initiative, an economic development nonprofit that works in Monessen and other communities south of Pittsburgh.The group helped secure funding for the conversion of the abandoned building that once housed an Eisenberg’s department store into 13 residential housing units. It is one of the bright spots in Monessen. Construction is expected to be completed in June.But even that project is a lesson in how long it can take to turn around a blighted steel town. The store, which opened about 100 years ago, closed in 1997 and stood vacant for nearly 20 years before renovations began.Some residents are willing to give Trump more time, but others are growing impatient and want more action on the president’s promise to reinvigorate the steel sector.John Golomb, 65 years old, voted for Donald Trump last fall. But says his patience has already worn thin. He points to what he sees as the president’s early stumbles and too little movement on the jobs front. After years of voting for Democrats, he now doubts his decision to cast a ballot for Mr. Trump. “I voted for this gentleman, and now I don’t know how to feel,” he said. Mr. Golomb said he believed Mr. Trump’s promises to reinvigorate the steel sector but that the president’s recent memorandum opening an investigation into whether cheap steel imports could affect national security wasn’t enough. “He’s had enough time to breathe life back into American steel,” Mr. Golomb said. He said he was troubled by the administration’s handling of the FBI investigation into whether there was collusion between Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. “Is the truth dead in the White House?” Mr. Golomb asked.Jocelyn Golomb, 20, who voted for Hillary Clinton, has witnessed her father’s change of heart. She said she was glad her father has come closer to her views on the president. “My father should have listened to me in the first place,” she said.Emory Terensky, a 66-year-old Republican and Air Force veteran, says people like his lifelong friend, Mr. Golomb, need to give the president more time to make good on his pledge to bring back steel and other industrial jobs. Messrs. Terensky and Golomb grew up on the same street in the former steel town. Years later, after they lost their jobs when the mill in Monessen shut down, they drove together every day for 16 years to another in Ohio. Both men put their hopes in Mr. Trump to spark a revival of the manufacturing sector that would lift Monessen. “It’s a positive,” Mr. Terensky said of the president’s focus on steel imports. “It shows that he’s doing something. Obama did absolutely nothing for the steel industry.” Mr. Terensky likes Mr. Trump’s attempts to temporarily restrict some refugees from entering the U.S. and applauds his push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Terensky dismissed the FBI probe into ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia. “It’s so partisan, it’s laughable,” he said.He blamed the courts and Democrats in Congress for thwarting some of Mr. Trump’s early efforts. “No matter what, Democrats stick together,” he said. “They’re trying to gang up on him.”Marvin Davis, city code-enforcement officer and Hillary Clinton voter, said Mr. Trump’s first days in office hadn’t changed his low expectations for the president. Mr. Davis, 66, has opposed Mr. Trump’s efforts to institute a temporary travel ban on some refugees entering the U.S. and his attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and then replace it, though he said the moves weren’t unexpected given Mr. Trump’s campaign promises. Beyond this, Mr. Davis said he thinks Mr. Trump needs to build a broader consensus on issues, instead of relying on a tight circle of advisers. He also wants Mr. Trump to speak to the nation more inclusively. “One of the things that really troubles me, is that Donald Trump feels that he can work the country the way he worked his businesses,” Mr. Davis said. “I think he’s got to open his mind and heart to other people, Democrats as well.”He recalled that Mr. Trump visited Monessen during the campaign last year, and he said he thought many voters had been “bamboozled” by talk of reviving the steel industry. “There are some people here that still think he can do some things here,” he said. But he doesn’t think Mr. Trump will return to the region unless he runs for office again. “I don’t think we’ll ever see him again.” Write to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.comFrench Election: Macron and Le Pen Through to Final Round",

      "text" : "WASHINGTON — When it came time to make his case for the judgment of history, President Barack Obama had a ready rebuttal to one of the most cutting critiques of his time in office.Although friends and foes alike faulted him for not following through on his threat to retaliate when Syria gassed its own people in 2013, Mr. Obama would counter that he had actually achieved a better result through an agreement with President Bashar al-Assad to surrender all of his chemical weapons.After last week, even former Obama aides assume that he will have to rethink that passage in his memoir. More than 80 civilians were killed in what Western analysts called a sarin attack by Syrian forces — a chilling demonstration that the agreement did not succeed. In recent days, former aides have lamented what they considered one of the worst moments of the Obama presidency and privately conceded that his legacy would suffer.“If the Syrian government carried out the attack and the agent was sarin, then clearly the 2013 agreement didn’t succeed in its objective of eliminating Bashar’s C.W.,” or chemical weapons, said Robert Einhorn, who was the State Department special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control under Mr. Obama before the agreement. “Either he didn’t declare all his C.W. and kept some hidden in reserve, or he illegally produced some sarin after his stock was eliminated — most likely the former.”Other former Obama advisers questioned the wisdom of negotiating with Mr. Assad and said last week’s attack illustrated the flaws in the deal, which was brokered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a way to prevent the United States from using force.“For me, this tragedy underscores the dangers of trying to do deals with dictators without a comprehensive, invasive and permanent inspection regime,” said Michael McFaul, who was Mr. Obama’s ambassador to Russia. “It also shows the limits of doing deals with Putin. Surely, the Russians must have known about these C.W.”Putting the best face on it, former Obama advisers said it was better to have removed 1,300 tons of chemical weapons from Syria even if Mr. Assad cheated and kept some, or later developed more. “Imagine what Syria would look like without that deal,” said Antony J. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state. “It would be awash in chemical weapons, which would fall into the hands of ISIS, Al Nusra or other groups.”Still, the administration knew all along that it had probably not gotten all of the chemical weapons, and tried to get Russia to help press Syria, without success. “We always knew we had not gotten everything, that the Syrians had not been fully forthcoming in their declaration,” Mr. Blinken said.Even before last week’s chemical attack, many veterans of Mr. Obama’s team considered his handling of Syria his biggest failing and expressed regret that their administration did not stop a war that has left more than 400,000 dead and millions displaced.Many of them even praised President Drumpf for taking the very action that Mr. Obama refused to take four years ago, by ordering a cruise missile strike against Syria. “Donald Drumpf has done the right thing on Syria,” Anne-Marie Slaughter, the director of policy planning in Mr. Obama’s State Department, wrote on Twitter. “Finally!! After years of useless handwringing in the face of hideous atrocities.”Tom Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state for human rights for Mr. Obama, wrote in The Atlantic, “The lesson I would draw from that experience is that when dealing with mass killing by unconventional or conventional means, deterrence is more effective than disarmament.”Mr. Obama grappled with Syria for much of his tenure but resisted being directly drawn in, for fear of thrusting America into another Middle East quagmire without solving the problem. The most searing moment came in 2013, when Mr. Assad’s forces killed 1,400 civilians with chemical weapons, brazenly crossing what Mr. Obama had said would be his “red line.”Mr. Obama prepared a military strike to retaliate, but hesitated amid domestic opposition in both parties and asked Congress to decide whether to proceed. When it became clear that Congress would not give its approval, he grabbed onto a political lifeline from Mr. Putin, who proposed a deal in which Mr. Assad would give up his chemical weapons arsenal.Under the deal, Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention, and over the next nine months, vast stores of lethal poisons were removed and ultimately destroyed. In June 2014, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons certified that all of Syria’s declared weapons had been removed.Two months later, when the last chemicals were destroyed, Mr. Obama celebrated. “Today we mark an important achievement in our ongoing effort to counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction by eliminating Syria’s declared chemical weapons stockpile,” he said in a statement.In the months to come, Mr. Obama and his aides pointed to that agreement in response to criticism that he had failed to enforce his red line. “Well, it turns out we’re getting chemical weapons out of Syria without having initiated a strike,” Mr. Obama said in April 2014. “So what else are you talking about?”Three months later, Secretary of State John Kerry said, “With respect to Syria, we struck a deal where we got 100 percent of the chemical weapons out.” And three months after that, Mr. Kerry said Mr. Obama’s threat of force had made it possible to “cut the deal that got 100 percent of the declared chemical weapons out of Syria, and people nevertheless have been critical — one day of bombing versus the virtue of getting 100 percent of the chemical weapons out of Syria.”As late as this January, Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, said on NPR: “We were able to find a solution that didn’t necessitate the use of force that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria in a way that the use of force would never have accomplished. We were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile.”Publicly, Mr. Obama’s advisers sometimes referred to “known” or “declared” stockpiles to qualify their claims, and sometimes did not. But from the start of the deal, there were discrepancies in Mr. Assad’s weapons declarations.In February 2016, James R. Clapper Jr., the national intelligence director, told Congress that “we assess that Syria has not declared all the elements of its chemical weapons program.” Moreover, Mr. Assad’s forces resorted to makeshift chlorine bombs, using a chemical that was not covered by the agreement and is not barred by international law, though its use as a weapon of war is.Mr. Blinken said the Obama administration had pressed the United Nations to respond, but Russia blocked such efforts.Critics say Mr. Obama oversold the agreement with Russia. “The defense was that he got all the C.W. out, and now that defense is shown to be plain false,” said Elliott Abrams, a deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush. “If Obama administration officials knew that at the time, they were deliberately misstating the facts. I think Obama will never live this down, nor should he.”Frederic C. Hof, who worked on Syria policy at the State Department under Mr. Obama before leaving and becoming a sharp critic of the administration, said the agreement remained defensible because it took weapons out of Mr. Assad’s hands.But Mr. Hof noted that Mr. Assad was still left “free to perform mass homicide by other means,” and that neither Mr. Obama’s deal nor Mr. Drumpf’s missile strike would stop him.“He now counts on the West again to leave him free to kill as long as he does so without chemicals,” Mr. Hof said. “If this is what happens, the U.S. airstrikes of April 7 will go down in history as a one-off, one-time, fire-and-forget gesture that did nothing to counter violent extremism, stop mass homicide or restore the reputation of the U.S.”",

Ron Maass, the incident commander, said Anderson had gone to the classroom to visit Smith. There is no indication the suspect's handgun was visible when he entered the school, Maass said.Anderson signed in at the front office when he entered the school, according to Maass. He said he believed Anderson was known to the front office. Burguan said Anderson told employees in the office he wanted to drop something off with his wife and then headed to the classroom. He added that it is not uncommon for a spouse to gain access to a school campus to meet with their spouse.\"He came in, and very, very quickly upon entering the classroom started shooting,\" Burguan said.

      "text" : "https://www.wsj.com/articles/control-geeks-tech-founders-want-ipo-investors-not-their-input-1491236464Companies that go public on the New York Stock Exchange usually celebrate by ringing the opening bell from a balcony crowded with executives and employees. Snap Inc. SNAP -0.80% had only two: co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, who control about 90% of the voting power in Snapchat’s parent.Snap was the first major company since at least 2000 to do an initial public offering in the U.S. that gave new shareholders no voting rights whatsoever, and earlier investors got one vote for every 10 held by the two co-founders.Their viselike grip on the disappearing-message app is an extreme example of a growing power grab by technology companies when they go public.Those companies are structuring their IPOs so that founders and executives wind up with far more votes than actual shares. The exaggerated voting power gives those few shareholders dominance over all corporate decisions, ranging from the election of directors to whether to sell the company someday.About 15% of the tech companies that went public in the U.S. between 2012 and 2016, including Facebook Inc., Fitbit Inc. and Twilio Inc., did so with at least two classes of stock, up from 8% between 2007 and 2011, according to data compiled by University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter. That ownership structure makes it possible for companies to assign different voting rights to different groups of shareholders, as Facebook did in its IPO in 2012. Class B shares held by Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and other early investors have 10 votes per share, while Class A shares sold to the public have one vote per share. Snap has three classes of shares.The tech industry’s use of so-called supervoting shares has climbed so much in the past five years that it is roughly in line with IPOs as a whole. The percentage of newly public tech companies with supervoting shares is likely to climb even higher if the market for new offerings continues to rebound and corporate executives are emboldened by the successful stock-market debuts so far this year, including Snap.Investment bankers and lawyers expect that the vast majority of the highest-valued companies that are now private would use some form of dual-class structure if they decide to go public. The most valuable companies include Uber Technologies Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc.On Friday, Snap shares closed at $22.53, up a third from their $17-a-share offering price March 1, valuing the five-year-old company at roughly $27 billion. Snap raised $3.9 billion in the IPO, according to Dealogic. Snap declined to comment on why Messrs. Spiegel and Murphy were the only employees on the NYSE balcony when the stock began trading.In the first quarter, there were 29 IPOs of U.S.-listed companies, up from nine a year earlier. Just four of the IPOs in the latest quarter were by tech companies, according to Dealogic, and 2016 was the slowest year for tech IPOs since the financial crisis.Since Snap’s stock sale, though, investment bankers and lawyers who work with tech companies say they have been fielding phone calls from closely held companies that are considering going public and are eager to explore similar share-class structures.The shift troubles some investors, corporate-governance advocates and even Silicon Valley executives. They say watered-down voting power hurts shareholder democracy and leaves those investors vulnerable.“It reduces the role of a board member to that of an adviser who works at the behest or pleasure of the founder,” says Mark Lonergan, founder and managing partner of executive-search firm Lonergan Partners in Redwood City, Calif.The Council of Institutional Investors, which represents large pension funds and other shareholders, has proposed barring Snap from stock-market indexes such as the S&P 500 because the company’s structure “will undermine the quality and confidence of public shareholders in the market.”Snap could become eligible to join the S&P 500 after the company is profitable for four quarters in a row. Analysts and investors don’t expect that to happen for at least two years.Officials at S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the stock benchmark, have said they would consider Snap’s corporate governance as part of their overall review. Matt MacInnis, chief executive of Inkling Systems Inc., based in San Francisco, has qualms about creating two classes of stock but wouldn’t rule it out if the labor-management software company eventually decides to go public. Inkling has raised $95 million from venture-capital investors since its launch in 2009.“There’s an element of: ‘We’ll take money from common shareholders, but we’re not accountable to them,’” Mr. MacInnis says.It’s hard for investors to resist promising tech IPOs even if that means they will wind up with little or no voice at the company. “As a firm, we much prefer shareholder-friendly management teams and boards with good corporate governance,” says Dan Ernst, a senior analyst at asset manager Welch Capital Partners LLC in New York. “But if you’re dogmatic, you won’t get a chance to participate in Facebook or Google.” Vivek Wadhwa, a distinguished fellow at Carnegie Mellon University’s College of Engineering, says the “winner-take-all” culture in which a few tech companies emerge as hugely profitable from among a far-larger number that fail encourages investors to give tech executives more leeway.As a result, “CEOs in Silicon Valley now have god complexes,” he says.Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook have gained nearly $800 billion in combined stock-market value since their initial public offerings. Alphabet shares are up nearly 1,900% since their debut in 2004, while Facebook is up nearly 300%, trouncing the overall stock market.When Google went public, co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and CEO Eric Schmidt held 33% of the internet search giant’s shares and 38% of the voting power. Mr. Brin is now Alphabet’s president, Mr. Page is chief executive and Mr. Schmidt is executive chairman.Facebook’s Mr. Zuckerberg held 28% of the shares and 58% of the voting power at the time of the social-networking company’s IPO in 2012.Google now sells a nonvoting class of stock, and Facebook plans to issue nonvoting stock. The companies have said different types of stock help executives manage for the long run, rather than worry about appeasing investors who are fixated on short-term gains. Spencer Rascoff, chief executive of Zillow Group Inc., which has three classes of stock, wrote in a LinkedIn post in 2015 that supervoting shares should assuage private-company CEOs who are wary about going public. “There is a way to have the benefits of being public while keeping a company quick to move and focused on the long term,” he wrote.Numerous academic studies show no statistical difference between the stock-price performance of companies with supervoting shares and those without, according to Mr. Ritter, the Florida finance professor. His own study came to a similar conclusion. Zynga Inc. founder Mark Pincus held a class of shares with 70 votes per share when the videogame company went public in 2011. Its share price fell from $10 to about $3 as Zynga’s user base declined.Mr. Pincus is Zynga’s chairman and has been its chief executive twice. He still holds 70% of the total voting power.Some investors have complained that his huge voting stake has made it difficult for another leader to emerge and take Zynga in a new direction.Frank Gibeau, Zynga’s chief executive since March 2016, said in February that the company has “made significant progress this year in our turnaround.” News Corp , the owner of The Wall Street Journal’s parent, Dow Jones & Co., has two classes of shares, which allow Rupert Murdoch and his family to maintain greater influence over the media company.Class A shares that make up about two-thirds of News Corp’s equity base have no voting power, while Mr. Murdoch and his family trust hold about 39% of the Class B voting shares. He is executive chairman of News Corp.Supervoting shares have been around for more than a century and began to proliferate in the 1920s. Dodge Brothers Inc., the auto maker that later became part of Chrysler, raised more than $100 million in an offering that limited the voting power of new investors. In 1940, the NYSE limited the use of multiple classes of stock.Some companies responded by listing their shares on other exchanges, and the NYSE made a few exceptions to its own curbs. Ford Motor Co. went public in 1956 in what was then the largest IPO ever. The sale gave the Ford family control far in excess of its financial stake, and the structure is still in place.The advent of corporate raiders in the 1980s led to a resurgence in supervoting shares as companies sought to protect themselves from unwanted takeovers. The NYSE sought to abandon its policy, but the Securities and Exchange Commission put forth a rule that would have prohibited dual-class shares. It was invalidated by an appeals court.By the time Google went public in 2004, the dual-class structure was widely accepted by stock exchanges, investors and regulators, including the NYSE. Google’s debut encouraged other tech companies to do the same.In a prospectus, Google cited media companies such as Dow Jones, then a stand-alone company, and New York Times Co. and said their separate classes of shares made it possible to concentrate on “core, long-term interest in serious news coverage, despite fluctuations in quarterly results.”Lately, a wave of shareholder activism, driven occasionally by investors like billionaire Carl Icahn, has helped prompt some companies to consider creating new classes of shares as protection.Long before Snap went public, Messrs. Spiegel and Murphy were intent on keeping as much control of the company as possible, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Spiegel is chief executive, and Mr. Murphy is chief technology officer.They wanted to decide what Snap should do and which products to create whether or not anyone else agreed, the people say. Messrs. Spiegel and Murphy also don’t want to be pushed to accept a takeover offer, which would eliminate the chance to build Snap for the long term.In mid-October, Snap officials held a meeting to initiate the IPO process, the people said. Snap’s investment bankers, from securities firms that included Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., were told to arrive at one of Snap’s warehouses in Venice, Calif., in any vehicle but a black car and without suits to ensure that word of the meeting wouldn’t leak.Snap told the dozens of investment bankers at the meeting that it wanted the IPO to include only nonvoting shares, people familiar with the meeting say. No one raised objections or questions about the plan, a sign that the bankers believed few prospective investors would balk. At a lunch meeting with potential IPO investors in New York in late February, Mr. Spiegel and Snap’s chief financial officer and chief strategy officer were asked mostly about the company’s growth prospects and ability to ward off competition, according to people who went to the meeting.Snap’s near-absolute control by Messrs. Spiegel and Murphy and their decision to sell shares with no voting power came up only in a small number of private meetings with potential investors, the people say.A person familiar with the initial public offering said he knows of only one investment fund that could have bought Snap shares but decided not to because of the 90.5% voting stake held by the two co-founders, who hold 38.4% of the company’s shares.Snap got orders for more than 10 times as many shares as the number that were for sale in the IPO.

      "text" : "Khloe Kardashian. Photo: Cindy Ord/Getty Images  Khloe Kardashian is in trouble for doing what she does best on Instagram: sharing photos of herself. The reality-TV star is facing a lawsuit from the photo agency Xposure Photos for allegedly sharing an unlicensed image of theirs on Instagram. The U.K.-based photo agency filed suit in California and states that Kardashian or someone on her team might have shared an image of her taken by Manual Munoz and subsequently licensed to the Daily Mail, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The complaint cites an image Kardashian reportedly shared on September 14, 2016, and goes on to say that the copyright information on the image was edited out. The agency is seeking an injunction, $25,000 in statutory damages, and profits resulting from the alleged licensing infringement. At the heart of the issue for Xposure Photos is the fact that by sharing the image to her almost 70 million followers on Instagram, Kardashian cut into any potential profits the agency would likely have made by selling the photo elsewhere. “Kardashian’s Instagram post made the photograph immediately available to her nearly 67 million followers and others … who would otherwise be interested in viewing licensed versions of the photograph in the magazines and newspapers that are plaintiff’s customers,” Xposure Photos said in a statement to Us Weekly. If $25,000 seems like a lot, consider this: Kardashian can reportedly earn up to $250,000 for a sponsored post on her social-media accounts, according to Us Weekly. Still, perhaps we’ll be seeing more selfies from here on out?",

Ask me your questions on the voicemail of the Dear Prudence podcast. Just leave a message at 401-371-DEAR (3327), and you may hear your question answered on a future episode of the show. Dear Prudence,\nI’m 12 years older than my sister and effectively raised her (and my brother) after our mother was killed when I was 15. Our father worked 80-hour weeks to provide for us, and I spent all of my teenage years and early 20s as a surrogate parent. My dad got remarried when I was 25 and I was finally able to go to college. My sister did not get along with our stepmother and spent weeks calling me and begging for me to come back home. Subscribe to Prudie! Now she’s 26, married, and expecting her first child. Our father and stepmother retired to Arizona, and our brother is in the military. When she called to tell me she was pregnant, I was so excited for her. I later told her that I’d finally gotten the promotion at work I have been waiting on for years. It’s my dream job, but it also means moving out of state; her exact response was, “You can’t move—what about me?” She told me I had to “stay for the baby,” things got heated, and she accused me of abandoning her like I did when I went to college. I told her to grow up and hung up on her. My sister has always been clingy but I figured she’d gotten past that after graduating college and getting married. I am so angry I can’t even imagine looking at her right now. I resent the fact she claims I abandoned her when I sacrificed my own childhood to raise her, and our father killed himself working to provide for us. Things weren’t perfect, I was a teenager, but I did my best. For her to fling that back in my face now—I honestly don’t know how to get past this. Advertisement —I’m Not Your Mom I think anger is an understandable first response in this case. What both you and your sister went through as children was profoundly difficult and destabilizing, and I have sympathy for how difficult the transition must have been for her when you went off to college. But the simple truth is that you didn’t abandon her then, and you’re not abandoning her now. Give your sister time and space to deal with her turbulent emotions. From what you say, you only had that one explosive phone call. When you feel calmer as well, tell her that you love her and can’t wait to meet her baby and to visit when you can but that you won’t apologize for getting your dream job or for becoming an independent adult and going to college in your mid-20s. In the meantime, if you’re having trouble functioning because of your anger, it would be worth talking with a therapist to sort through your resentment toward your sister (and possibly your father and stepmother) for the sacrifices you had to make as a child. You’ve done a lot to care for the other people in your family; do this to care for yourself. * * * Advertisement Dear Prudence, I work two jobs from home. One is structured so that I have 9-to-5 work hours, and the other I do in my “off” time. My problem is my husband, who cannot seem to wrap his head around the fact that just because I am home does not mean I am “available.” He constantly interrupts my working time to talk to me about things that could wait, including arguments he wants to have right now. He asks that I spend time with him before he leaves for work by moving my laptop into whatever room he is in. He often expects me to take time away from my desk in order to help him get ready for his job, and I am really frustrated. I have said time and again that I am at work and he needs to respect it, but nothing seems to stick, and sometimes I get so peeved with him it distracts me the rest of the work day. I love my husband, but his constant inability to respect my work time and space is getting on my last nerves. Help! —Work Stoppage Your problem is both logistical and relational, and you, lucky writer, will get to address both aspects with your husband. First, sit him down and outline the problem as you see it, as well as the strategy you’re going to use from now on. His constant interruptions are irritating, distracting, and disrespectful, which is hardly conducive to a happy marriage. You’ve asked him repeatedly to stop and he’s failed to do so, and short of moving out you’re going to have to set a harder limit with him until he learns that “working from home” is not shorthand for “aimlessly surfing the internet and delighted by interruptions.” Tell your husband, “From now on, when I start work in the morning, I’m not going to be available to answer questions, settle disputes, or help you get ready. It will be just as if I were in an office, and we can catch up after my workday is finished.” Then follow through by not making yourself available. You don’t say whether your working space has a door you can close. It’s easy to underestimate how important that door is: If you don’t have one, please get one. He is a grown man, and can put on his own pants, or hard hat, or glitter, or whatever it is that his job requires him to have on his person. Do not move your laptop into whatever room he wants you to be in, do not answer his question about whether you are still out of milk. Let “I can’t talk right now; I’m at work” be your mantra. If he invades your space, say, “I can’t talk right now; I’m at work” again. Say it mildly and without rancor, but don’t stray from it; as soon as you reward his attention-seeking behavior with attention, good or bad, he’ll persist. (This does not appear to be your husband’s most lovable attribute! Let us hope he has other, better ones.) You may be tempted to argue or justify yourself to him if he continues to interrupt you, but don’t do it. Put on your headphones, close the door, and ignore him until you’re done for the day. Advertisement * * * Dear Prudence, My mother abandoned me when I was 13. This has had a profoundly negative impact on my life. I’m now in my 30s and have spent thousands of dollars on psychiatrists, therapists, and medication for depression. I’ve accepted it, but I can’t “get over it” the way people tell me to. Mother’s Day and the weeks leading up to it are a huge slap in the face, a constant reminder that my mother left and never came back. I’m a restaurant manager, and it’s the busiest day of the year, so it’s not an option to stay home. I absolutely hate seeing happy girls out celebrating with their moms. I just want to cry and scream and smash everything because it’s not fair that I don’t have a mom, and I will never fully understand why she left. My question is, how do I respond when people ask if I get to spend time with my mom that day? The question angers me and I usually tell people she’s dead, just so I can see the shock on their face and make them feel sorry for me. I know it’s immature, but sometimes I wish she had died because that would mean that she hadn’t chosen to leave. What can I say to people to get them to drop the subject? Is it appropriate to just say she’s dead? It’s so much easier to explain than the real situation. —No Mom on Mother’s Day Advertisement This is a great opportunity to remind all readers that “What are you doing for Mother’s Day?” is not innocuous in the same way that “What are you up to this weekend?” and “Seen any good movies lately?” are, and to tread carefully if you’re not sure how someone feels about their mother. That said, it’s not an out-and-out rude or socially inappropriate question, so even if hearing it makes you want to start hurling knives, there’s no need to lie or say something shocking and designed to shut up your interlocutor. If the person asking is a customer or a stranger, stick with something vague and impersonal, like, “I haven’t got anything planned—how about you?” If it’s an acquaintance or a co-worker, it’s fine to say, “No, we’re not close,” and politely decline to discuss the subject further. Anything more than that will have to wait for your therapist’s office. For what it’s worth, the people who care for you should not be insisting you “get over” this pain. You suffered a wound that may never fully heal, and my only concern is that these misdirections about your mother won’t help you. * * * Dear Prudie: The “Hardly Working” Edition requirejs([ 'premium-panoply', 'css!../css/components/premium-panoply' ], function (premiumPanoply) ); Hear more Prudence at Slate.com/PrudiePod. Dear Prudence, My partner and I have been together for eight years. We live together, and I’ve raised my partner’s daughter as my own since she was a year old, when her mother lost her parental rights and disappeared. I adore my stepdaughter, but her father and I have recently been having trouble. A few years ago he met a woman with two teenage daughters and some mental health issues, and they became close; I met her for the first time about a year ago. Recently I learned that both this woman and her daughters are in daily communication with my partner. They invite him over after work, ask him to run errands or take them to the doctor and chat endlessly. I am largely excluded from this relationship and have limited contact with them. On Easter, my partner invited them to a big picnic with his extended family. It was really awkward. He flitted back and forth between us. Admittedly I am shy and struggled to find topics of conversation, but I felt very uncomfortable having them there. Afterward, I told my partner that it felt like he was trying to maintain two separate relationships. He said I was a narcissist who wanted “the sun to shine only for me” and that I was mad I wasn’t the center of attention. I am extremely hurt and really don’t know what to do. I don’t like this relationship, but he doesn’t seem responsive to my feelings. There is also the added dilemma of our daughter. If I decide to leave the relationship I probably wouldn’t be able to see her again, and that thought hurts more than anything. —Is There Any Chance? Until you adopt your partner’s daughter, it’s unlikely that you’d have any legal rights of visitation once you two split up, so make that a priority and consult a lawyer about that right away, regardless of whether you and her father stay together. If you’re the only mother she’s ever known and her biological mother has relinquished her parental rights, you should adopt her anyway, if only to ensure you’d be able to continue caring for her if something ever happened to her father. A lawyer will be able to give you a sense of how difficult this process may be, or what roadblocks your partner might throw in your way, should your relationship continue to deteriorate. You need to take steps to protect the familial relationship you’ve established with this girl before doing anything else. As for your partner: Whether he’s having a physical affair with this woman is beside the point. He goes over to her house alone after work on a regular basis, is close with her children, speaks to her every day, and has started inviting her to family functions—he’s very much in a relationship with her, and the fact that he responded with such defensiveness when you pointed that out to him smacks of a guilty conscience. You don’t have to buy into his twisted version of reality, where asking him to make your relationship a priority is somehow equivalent to “narcissism.” If he’s not willing to listen to how you feel or change anything about how he interacts with this woman, then an eventual breakup is likely in your future—depending on what you’re willing to deal with (and for how long) in order to keep your stepdaughter in your life. In the meantime, however, you should take all available precautions to protect your connection with her, if and when your relationship with her father officially ends. * * * Dear Prudence, A very close friend of mine died very suddenly at age 30 just two weeks ago, and as a result, I’ve been fielding a lot of messages from our mutual friends, including acquaintances who went to school with us but who lost touch with him years ago. They keep asking how he died—one person who didn’t know him even asked if he’d killed himself! (He didn’t, and there was no reason to assume that he had.) This has been very difficult to address repeatedly, but I’d rather be the one to answer those invasive questions than his family members. His mom expressed great relief that no one had asked her this (yet). I’m trying to be understanding because it’s natural to be curious when someone dies young, but many of them didn’t even know him, and I’m starting to lose patience. His funeral was this weekend, and I hoped the questions would stop after the service, but they haven’t. Only a few people know the exact details of his death, and his family doesn’t want everyone to know. I’m keeping my answers concise and matter-of-fact without giving too much away, but I’m struggling with it, and I’m worried I’m eventually going to snap and say something rude. It’s not any one person that is getting to me, just the accrual of questions coming from everyone. When can I expect these questions to stop? Am I allowed to shut the questions down, or is that rude? I don’t want people bugging his family for information if they can’t get it from me. —Tired of Rubberneckers If someone who never even knew your friend calls or texts you to ask how he died, please feel enormously free to ignore them for as long as you like. Sure, it’s natural to be curious when someone dies young, but it’s also natural for adults to periodically rein in their curiosity rather than demand information from the bereaved to satisfy their spirit of inquiry, especially when the dead person in question was a stranger to them. You can also simply say, “I’m not comfortable going into detail,” if you’re worried these questioners won’t stop badgering you until you give them some sort of reply. “I don’t know,” “the details aren’t publicly available,” or “I just can’t talk about it right now” are also perfectly acceptable. Surely even those people would not be so shockingly rude as to then contact his grieving mother for the latest gossip if you declined to furnish them with details, so don’t feel you’re “forcing” them to get in touch with his family members if you don’t offer up the bullet-points version of his death. A Slate Plus Special Feature: Help! My Mansplaining Boyfriend Keeps Telling Me I’m Doing It Wrong. Dear Prudence answers more of your questions—only for Slate Plus members. * * * Dear Prudence, My girlfriend is over 18 but under 21. I don’t drink, so that’s not a problem; however, I do smoke cigarillos and ride a motorcycle. She wants to ride, but I don’t feel ready for a passenger. I have given her cigarillos, and she said she’s excited to be a smoker now. She also said that if I won’t let her ride my motorcycle, she’ll have to get her own. I’m feeling a bit guilty about what I’ve introduced her to. Our mothers are friends, and I’ve learned that her mother is quite upset about her smoking, and terrified at the prospect of her daughter riding a motorcycle. (My mother is not happy about me doing those things, either.) Should I stop smoking and riding and hope that my girlfriend loses interest also? I like being a “badass,” but I don’t want to lead someone else astray. —Bad Influence I find it deeply charming that you both long to be tough and a good example to your girlfriend. It’s not especially badass, I’m afraid, but it is highly endearing. It is always a good idea to quit smoking! Quitting smoking (even cigarillos) does not get easier with time, and it’s less “exciting” than expensive and, eventually, distressing, so if you’re thinking about dropping the habit, there’s no time like the present. As for the motorcycle; if you’re not ready to take on a passenger, then make that clear to your girlfriend and stick to it. You don’t have to give it up entirely just because she’s expressed a (thus-far abstract) desire to get one herself, but if you don’t feel comfortable being responsible for her safety on your bike, then don’t let her ride with you. Beyond that, what your girlfriend decides to do with her life will be up to her. Discuss this column with Dear Prudence on her Facebook page!
